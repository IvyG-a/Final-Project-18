12. Dance to your favorite songs (and then send that video to your friends so that they can laugh too).

11. Binge watch your favorite tv series AGAIN (the one with the.. You know, I meant FRIENDS).

10. Read that book (the one in the corner of your room that you never read because of it's size).

9. Clean your laptop (which you aren't doing from last few years).

8. Sing out loud, like really loud (let your neighbors know that you are safe and sound).

7. Paint/Write (you were never good at either of them but who cares?).

6. Now is the time, return money to your friends (Restaurants and bars are closed, you'll never be able to save more money than this).

5. Call/Facetime your friends (stay strong to hear some swear words, because you haven't called them in years).

4. Follow WHO on twitter and read everything that is from official sources. Do not spread news that you are not sure about (Some television and media are already doing that, you don't have to add more to it).

3. Checkout globalcitizen.org/coronavirus to know how you can take action by sitting at home and help people who are fighting this evil. (Also, they are promoting virtual concerts, tune in and listen to your favorite singers and bands playing musing just for you on your demands).

2. Work and attend the skype meetings (ofcourse, if you got some time after doing everything else).

1. Tomorrow at 5PM IST come out at your windows, balconies, doors and appreciate everyone who are working 24*7 to keep us safe.(Also let's post thousands of appreciation posts on instagram and let it crash for one more time because you already know about instagram servers. Duh!).

In the last weeks, you have probably stumbled upon some articles titled something like SELF-QUARANTINE : YOUR SURVIVAL GUIDE or HOW TO SURVIVE SELF-QUARANTINE and articles like these just elicit fear and anxiety among its readers. So Ive decided to take another approach, to change your perspective and encourage you to actually enjoy the remaining days of your self-quarantine.

First and to ease your mind, allow me to point out that once you look beyond the fear and anxiety, you will understand that there is an expiration date. You dont know when, but you know there is one. That alone will give you the strength to endure.  This is the power of impermanence.

I know as youre going through it, it might not seem that way as theres a natural human inclination to think that whatever is going on is the way its always going to be. Obviously, thats not the case. This will be over again. It might be a few weeks, it might be a few months but it is going to end.

Allow me also to point out that you currently have one incredible asset in your possession that most people usually dont have in their lives which is time.  
Time is maybe the one asset in life you cant replace and we spend it usually running around going paycheck to paycheck hustling and bustling& We have a period now where we dont have a choice but to have some time. Were stuck at home and that is actually an incredible opportunity.

I am going to list a lot of action steps that I consider very important so you can choose the ones youre interested in and focus on them.

The idea is to get you doing those things and do as much relaxation or entertainment as you want. That will be your reward! Whats important is that you enjoy your reward.

Lets get right to it...

&amp;#x200B;

#### Be kind

Take 15 minutes from your day to call your grandparents or anyone you know who is especially at risk of complications from the virus.  
Check in on elderly neighbors you know (while keeping your distance). If they need supplies and feel unsafe going to the store, offer to go for them; or just give them a call to see how they are doing. And if you order something to your house, like pizza, generously tip the delivery guy.

&amp;#x200B;

#### Stay healthy (Physically)

This is not a health pandemic. So please please please stay healthy!  
Dont get fat, keep eating well : get your fruits and vegetables. Take Vitamin D by getting some sunlight.  
This is a great moment to establish healthy routines by changing our diet and incorporating better nutrients into it.

Its also a great time to catch up on your sleep and let your body figure out your own personal circadian rhythm.

&amp;#x200B;

#### Stay healthy (Mentally)

You can safely go outside while avoiding close contact with other people and touching surfaces that may be infected, and sometimes, this is the best thing you can do for your mental health. Soaking up sunshine and breathing fresh air will help rejuvenate you and make you feel better.  
You can also practice your walking past a stranger awkward smile& you know the one&

Weve all tried time and time again to get into a meditation routine, but there always seems to be something (like life, yknow!) that gets in the way. Well, now that many of us are staying home during the day we have the perfect chance to follow through on making this a new habit.

Another habit you can practice is self-care. It is one of the best things you can do to keep your mind healthy and happy. And self-care is imperative to stress management.  
And yes, for the guys reading this, its okay to practice some form of self-care. Its not exclusive to girls.

&amp;#x200B;

#### Stay fit

No gym? No problem! We are creatures of habit and as such we get used to our daily routines and rituals. This is a great time to try and challenge yourself in other ways.  
Try a new fitness app. Do some push-ups, do some sit-ups, do squats in your room whatever you have to do. The important thing is that you keep moving, get your blood pumping and sweat as much as you can. This will benefit your mind and body equally.

&amp;#x200B;

#### Read and study

One of the most amazing resources we have as human beings is the fact that we stand on the shoulders of giants. We dont have to relearn everything from scratch we dont have to figure everything out, almost everything you want to learn has been written down somewhere, its been put into a course by somebody or into a very good self-improvement blog (wink wink) so take advantage of this time to read a good book or study a subject that youve been wanting to study.

&amp;#x200B;

#### Stay connected

Remember the phone? A long time ago it was used for a lot more than just texting and Instagram. Pick it up and call a parent, friend, or co worker. FaceTime with your friends. Improve your relationship with your family.  
Its important to keep working on your social skills, dont get rusty in that area and dont go into this depressive isolated place. This is actually in some ways an opportunity to bridge new social connections or to deepen the social connections you already have.

&amp;#x200B;

#### Start your passion project

Not everyone is lucky enough to call their career or job their passion, but everyone has a passion.  Maybe you want to start a home bakery or maybe you want to start your entrepreneurial adventure, theres really no better time than when youre sitting around doing nothing to get that in place and get that started.

You dont have to complete whatever project you start in the amount of time we are on lockdown, but you can definitely get the ball rolling and really create some momentum that would allow you to finish it soon.

&amp;#x200B;

#### Learn a new skill

The business world is rapidly changing and new skills are needed constantly, but it can be nearly impossible to learn something new while youre just trying to keep your head above water at work. So take that online coding class, practice your video editing skills, or start learning a foreign language now. Imagine the surprise on your co-workers faces when you return from this hiatus speaking German!

There are lots of ways to teach yourself, with blogs, apps and online courses at your fingertips. If you learn a useful skill while away from the office, you will return to what may be a difficult job market with a leg up on your competition.","quarantineactivities",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/quarantineactivities/comments/g9bbyb/how_to_actually_enjoy_selfquarantine/"
"2020-06-05",1591362127,"Has quarantine helped you in improving your relationship with your parents?","**My Story**: These days of lockdown helped me realize how much less time I gave to my family. Even when I am at home, I'm mostly into my work and never realized we had so much less interaction.

The only time I gave would be mostly during dinner. I just complain about what all went wrong or what all went great my family would guide or celebrate with me accordingly.

I realize now, I never ask them how was their day but this lockdown as completely changed my relationship with my family.

Life has slowed down as this lockdown has taken a lot of our freedom but in exchange, it has has given us a lot of time to spend with our family. So now, I help my mother in her daily chores, learning from her, we crack jokes and laugh together and guess what **now I know her favorite song**.

This lockdown is giving me a lot of beautiful memories with my family. I am coming out of this lockdown as a better person and more importantly with a stronger bond with my family.","quarantineactivities",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/quarantineactivities/comments/gx45h1/has_quarantine_helped_you_in_improving_your/"

Dealing with acute depression, being able to work from home, and stay at home has been a real relief. Ive been more productive, at least work wise. I should put more effort in around the house, but havent got to that level of energy yet. But overall, I feel better than I did having to get up, get ready and get out the door 5 days a week. 

My wife was laid off, and she is a bit sir crazy, but I let her do all the grocery shopping, but she did that mostly anyway. I do usually take my dog for a walk, but thats about it, and it is really working for me. Going out, getting together socially is stressful. The visiting part is good, but getting ready and going is always a big effort for me. Having others come to visit is easier, as my wife takes care of the hosting responsibilities.

I will be glad when things return to normal because so many are suffering, including many family members, but hoping this break from the daily grind will give me more energy when I return to the office.

Instead I am stuck at home (but thankfully safe) with my mom, who isnt the most exciting person, god love her. I also cant go anywhere more than 2km further from my house as thats the rule in Ireland.

First, here are links to some giant lists of citizen-scholar projects. Poke around and find some that speak to you. Just be sure you can contribute while social distancing!

* [https://www.citizenscience.gov/catalog/#](https://www.citizenscience.gov/catalog/#)
* [https://www.zooniverse.org/projects](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects)
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_citizen\_science\_projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_citizen_science_projects)

And now, some of my favorite individual projects:

* [Fold.it](https://fold.it/)\- Probably the most famous crowdsourced science project, this protein-folding game made headlines when people power outperformed AI. You learn basic rules about how to ""fold"" complex shapes, and then try to solve puzzles based on real molecules. Bonus: they have puzzles directly based on Covid-19 molecules!
* [Eye Wire](https://eyewire.org/explore)\- Another 3D puzzle game, this one helps scientists map neural connections in the brain. Players have charted new circuits and even discovered (and named!) new types of neurons. Someday soon these maps will add incredible sophistication to scientists trying to treat brain diseases.
* [Stall Catchers](https://stallcatchers.com/main)\- Stalls are areas of reduced blood flow in the brain, and they're associated with Alzheimer's disease. Removing stalls might help treat Alzheimer's, they they're hard to find. Stall Catchers is an online game that crowdsources the goal of identifying stalls and moving us closer to a treatment for Alzheimer's.
* [GLOBE Observer: Clouds](https://observer.globe.gov/do-globe-observer/clouds)\- NASA collects tons of data about clouds via satellite, but they also want to know what these clouds look like from the ground. By taking pictures with the GLOBE: Clouds app, you can help atmospheric research. If you're interested, you can compare your data to that collected from space. Bonus: Not interested in clouds? Check out GLOBE Observer's other apps for measuring [mosquito habitats](https://observer.globe.gov/do-globe-observer/mosquitoes), [land cover](https://observer.globe.gov/do-globe-observer/land-cover), and [trees](https://observer.globe.gov/do-globe-observer/trees).
* [Biodiversity Heritage Library](https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2011/08/bhl-on-flickr.html)\- BHL has a truly gorgeous array of classic plant and animal art, but their collection is massive and they need help tagging the pictures. You don't need to be a biology genius- most labels are already in the image, you just need to add the tag. Then researchers and browsers alike can search the collection in a whole new way.
* [Anti-Slavery Manuscripts](https://www.antislaverymanuscripts.org/)\- Boston Library owns a giant collection of handwritten correspondence between anti-slavery activists. It's an incredibly important piece of history, but they're currently not databased or searchable. They need people like you to read and transcribe the letters so that students and historians can more easily learn from what these activists had to say.

And finally, a special mention to /r/scholar. Researchers need access to past research, but sometimes it's hard to find. If you have access to a scholarly database through your school, work, or library, consider helping these people dig up the articles they need.

"2020-04-03",1585876941,"Quarantine in New Orleans","I started this the day that my husband and I started the quarantine and then he lost his job (as the bars in New Orleans actually shut down) as I figured I needed a way to document a quick note about the oddity of whats going on and maybe find humor in the chaotic misery we are facing. 

Day 1 
Dont know how to prepare for this, so the New Orleanss Hurricane Preparation Mode sets in.  I start my checklist:
- [ ] cleaning up the yard from possible airborne debris
- [ ] Buy peanut butter and non-perishables
- [ ] Get gas in car
- [ ] Oh.... wait we will have electricity, water, and Im not going anywhere.  

Day 2
Realized I was supposed to get my dogs their mani/pedi last week. 
Now I have to figure out how to trim the 60lb neurotic pit bulls nails, who has known to express her anal glands at the sight of the nail trimmers.  

Day 3
Look in grocery chart and mumble through my mask... should we buy actual food and not just snacks? 
Husband throws one steak and a few frozen pizzas in cart.  

Day 4
Feeling optimistic and wrote a to do during quarantine list.  
Instead of starting any I binged ALL the social media and ate half a bag of mini powdered donuts.

Day 5 
Weird role reversal as I grounded my father today for leaving the house without notifying any of his children first.  

Day 6 
Should I hide some of the snacks that my husband is running through so I have some for later ?   
OR do I let him eat them all and consider this my way of dieting during the quarantine.  

Day 7
We started feeding the neighborhood feral cat a few days ago. Previously the next door neighbors were feeding him, but they went back to Mexico a week before quarantine.   I dont expect to see them ever again. 
The cat, Orange Cassidy, has claimed us and now Im its bitch.  It demands food at a certain place and time.   There is no exception. 

Day 8 
Caught up on ALL the Netflix I wanted to watch.  
Do I rewatch Breaking Bad again for the third time or do I actually read a book, one of the hundred of books that I squealed in joy to buy but then never opened again? 

Day 9
Husband decides to cut his own hair. I have become the trimmer of neck hair, cutter of the mustache and puller of ear hairs. 

Day 10
Isolation, a panic attack and bad reaction to medication caused me to run.  Literally run. I dont run.  I did this forgetting that I was wearing the pajama bottoms that lost their elasticity a week ago.  And hence my pjs fell to my ankles while in the middle of the street.  

Day 11
What day is it? 
Im tempted to put military time on my phone so I know if the sky is shades of pinks and blues because its sunrise or sunset or was Prince just off by 20 years and thats why the sky is all purple?

Day 12
We found a box of dominos.  Half my brain thinks is it smart to add competition to an already stressful environment and maybe stress my marriage?  
The other half just says I will crush you!

Day 13
We have run out of junk food and the boredom has set in.  
We have started cleaning.  I will find ALL the matching socks before this ends! 
My husband is threatening to fold the towels HIS way, I have to go stop him. 

Day 14 
Staying up late and napping has caused us to hate a very LOUD bird that begins its chirping around 2am til sunrise. 
Im hoping I can train the cat to attack on command.  Ive started making toys and tomorrow I start on an obstacle course.  
Hopefully this will all end with us having a super, trained ninja cat and no bird.  

Day 15
Partaking in adult substances and coming up with crazy business models to get rich.
Also realizing for the same money we would spend to board our dogs we could go on vacation tomorrow am via a flight, get a hotel and a rental car for two nights but....pandemic. 

Day 16
Husband and I decided at high noon tomorrow we recreate the scene in Indiana Jones where Marion drinks that local patron under the table.
We are not sure who shall claim the title of Marion.  

Day 17
Slept 9 hours, woke up and said no.... slept for 18 hours.  
Meanwhile, my Husband is manic and yard has never looked better.  
Found out someone I came near about a week ago has it. Eek!!  

Day 18
Went to testing site and it took about two hours.  Test wasnt that bad, these men complaining are super wimps.  Women are so much stronger.  
Husband asked oh my god, how far they stick that thing up your nose?

Day 19
10 year anniversary of the day we met (cant remember exact day so April Fools was close enough and seemed fitting for us).   
Instead of drinking an old bottle of champagne and celebrating it, it went bad.  Pandemic crazy bad.  We are not prepared for this mentally, especially me.  

Day 20 
Husband and his father had a trip planned to go to Normandy beach and visit WWII sites.   This year is the third time they have planned this vacation and each time there has been something awful happen that caused them to cancel.  One planned trip canceled due to my father came down with a super rare autoimmune disease.  Now has to cancel because of a crazy pandemic. 
Im not allowing them to plan this vacation again, in fear if they do Godzilla will come out of hiding and destroy us all.  


Day 21
Orange Cassidy  (our new feral cat) has learned to appear on demand, if he decides he wants to, and how to drive neurotic Pitt bull insane by sitting just on other side of fence, staring, doing flips onto back and cleaning itself.   Also has now made my husband its bitch too. 
Because of previously doing work on the house, we found an open box with THREE N95 masks!  Husband goes to grocery store and came home to say that everyone gave him a jealous stare and he felt all bougie.","quarantineactivities",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/quarantineactivities/comments/ftyvwi/quarantine_in_new_orleans/"

**This might be the very first dive**, or plunge if you so prefer, into a pool  of which neither of us know the contents. Dipping my little toes, which dont bend all that well, into whatever lies ahead, I have no idea what time will come to tell. But in my mind, I shall search and Ill rhyme, until I come upon Jormungandr, the world encompassing serpent.

*What the fuck is he getting at?,* is a question which you are more than in you right to ponder. As for me, I too am in a state of wonder, but will happily oblige in doing what I can, to shed some light on the situation at hand, as I have nothing but time to squander.

Feeling as fine as one could this morning, the sporadic rays of April sunlight which spring, bring, cheered me up, but brought no warning. Freshly brewed coffee filled my cup, lifting my spirits and ridding me of yawning, there was not the slightest shadow of a doubt in my mind that I yet again soon, was going to enjoy another fantastic day of work as the clock approached noon.

Heading out the door, into the street, however, a sensation of slight unease came over me, as unwelcome now, as ever before. Usually, a faint premonition of queasiness is an unavoidable part of all of our lives, which we simply must muster the strength to overcome. Now, with the current situation and delicate state of society, upon which fear has come to thrive, my disposition toward my own bodys reaction to whatever might be going on inside of myself, affects more people than one.

Even so, I thought my discomfort would come to pass, hopefully sooner rather than later. As most of the times when I feel the need to skip work or class, its usually due to gas, needing to be released from one end or the other. *Better out than in* I always say. 

At the conviction of said notion, I heaved myself upon my trusty bike, definitely quicker than some, and pedaled toward work, away from leisure. Both thinking, and hoping, sporting a smirk, that better times were to come, in a very immediate future.

If there is something I pride myself upon, it is having, maybe even *knowing,* the state of my own well-being. This to an extent which usually is reserved for machines, fitted with at least somewhat advanced programs of self-diagnostics and illness recognition. I wouldnt say that I am a Mac, per se, but if comparison had to be made, Id surely be able to run the never-ending-maze screensaver found on PCs back in the day. 

The vast amount of time of my childhood which consisted of staring at this maze, hoping that behind each corner finally would be the exit, and dreaming about what wonders lay beyond, it is a topic for another time, but also a welcome addition to this piece if Im to have my say. Regardless of amazing screensavers of yore, and not to wreck it, the core of the floor, is that I usually am able to form, an accurate opinion whether I am dying or not.

With the times we currently are living in being, lets say, a bit more *dire* than most, the flashing red light, like a benevolent ghost, indicating readings outside the normal parameters, today did shine with just that little bit of an extra crimson glow.  So as I gloriously attempted to make my way up the hill, which both to good effect and bad, leads me to where I earn my daily bread, a lesson was waiting to be had. To be clear, I dont get paid in bread though, as much as I for my troubles, am awarded my fair share of dough. 

Usually the good, is me reaching break-neck speeds, not biking as much as I fly. Coming back down the very same hill, after a day of hard labor and thrills, I find myself home within the blink of a weary eye. If a blink which lasts for 10 minutes straight, still is a blink, might be a matter for debate, but the notion remains the same. 

I know what you think; *Hey, that is more like a nap*! 

Even so, for the sake of this rap, well leave the haters to hate.

In regards to my Sisyphusian ventures, which I usually pass with flying colors, this morning I instead found myself bereft of breath. I too had a curiously accelerated heart rate, which I can tell you, is neither more fun nor duller, than a set of aching dentures.

So, being a responsible young adult these days, and beside my own, also caring about everyone elses fates, I turned on my (w)heel, and am now safely away, from anyone who might be in danger to keel.

If upon reading this jabber, anyone gets so disgusted, or amused for that matter, that their heart stops, jaw drops, or simply dont know how to feel, I apologize for sentences far too nonsensical and blatantly long, but this is an optional spiel. Thus I claim innocence, in terms of said outcomes, as the point I am coming from, is simply one of exuberance.

Now, sitting on the side on the pool, submerged up to my misaligned knees, into whatever substance which we yet do not know. Keeping my cool, like refrigerated cheese, this is the info Im able to bestow;

If I now am to be quarantined, for a period of time to come, hopeful I shall remain. If by being precautious, and/or precocious, well beat sickness at its own game, is still to be seen. But Im rather safe than sorry, rather smart than dumb, so Ill keep myself away. Whatever virus were facing, computer or real, one thing is sure and steady. This old Windows 98 is fighting ready, to come at our shared foe, floppy-disc turrets and CST-monitor blazing.","quarantineactivities",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/quarantineactivities/comments/ft0l82/quarantinereative_writing_day_1/"
"2020-03-24",1585092303,"Can bullets kill the virus?","They say it's goddamn chaos out there - this one guy said some woman shot her cat to keep it from catching the virus. Panic buying, social distancing, getting laid off, self quarantine...holy hell Hillary, where the fuck are you? Of course you're going to freakthefuckout...everyone else is. All you really know is they said on the news to stay home or people will die. They also said Trump was a still a racist and Jeffery Epstein killed himself. I mean, does anyone really know anything for sure? Anything can happen...that's how chaos works...

So, out of an abundance of caution you invite a military force complete with tanks and bombs into your home to keep you from going outside...where people are dying.

Once you find places for the guns, bodybags and the teddy bears they brought for the kids...you'll get comfy, maybe talk about the weather, the Seahawks...netflix perhaps, everyone likes a good war movie during quarantine. Soon everyone gets along kindly enough. Well, until the big dude from Memphis in the Ghillie suit needs to take a crap. Turns out...you don't have enough toilet paper for Memphis Slim with the shits and the rest of the platoon.

So, being a good host, you grab your car keys and cheerfully ask if anyone needs anything...because you're off to get more TP out of storage and stop at the pot shop on the way back. Noting silence, you open the door. In your face is an even bigger dude from Cleveland with an attack dog growling beside him...he plainly says to you...""go back inside"".

Will you?

People with guns do not take ""No"" for an answer.

Else I would not be capable to.

It means bouldering to strengthen my back.

So No. 1 Sport) 
Every two days sport.

Disconnecting from the Internet and combat loneliness. I already have only 5 GB on my phone remaining.

2)Family and friends

Strengthening my relationships with friends and family like this:

When I feel lonely, I visit my local neighborhood community. I often do community service there.

I will take occasionally my laptop with me, work on their website and chat with another programmer who helps on this website in his free time.

Or I'll go to to 2 different libraries which I am fond of and read books. 

I also have to learn for a test in March, but I realized I could not get anything done at home alone. I have to find a solution for this. 

I will do more community service. (cleaning the space of the club, talking with people there). Help to get new furniture with another guy. 

Reopening and maintaining(just a little bit, because it's a mess) the shop of free stuff there. 

2)Dating

Visit all events which could be relevant to me regarding LGBTQ+. I am a femme lesbian and want to have fun with my new found friends there. 

If I find a partner, it would be great. I will take a break from online dating, too exhausting. 

.) So the only solutions I have to find are: How do I stay at home to learn for the test in March?

Because everytime I do community service with others, I feel bad afterwards because I didn't do something ""productive"". What are your challenges?
