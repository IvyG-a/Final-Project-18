I would also point out (and I suspect something you already know) that most of these sites are just reposting the same jobs as the others. As such, a possibly more useful post (and I'm not saying YOU need to create it) is one that says how often each site is updated, and where skill X is likely to find the fastest action in response. Not sure anyone has looked that deeply into this yet, but I know that ""I"" would find something like that helpful. I've been keeping an eye on most of these for the past year, and I don't see that any one of them seems all that much better than the others. But then I'm looking for a remote PM/Scrum Master position and I don't think any of these are really focused on that :-)

Many employers (especially the medium and larger ones) have policies you've probably agreed to as part of your employment that try and restrict the kinds of second and third jobs (as well as hard core volunteering) you can do.  You likely can't work part time for another digital marketing company since they could be considered a competitor regardless of size.  You likely can't work freelance for a current client or do anything else that would present a conflict of interest.  And even though your current hours are casual, they're going to be unhappy if the part time work starts interfering with your full time, whether it's hours or productivity.

You're working from home, not at home while you work. 8-5, 9-6, whatever your hours are are your work hours.  Don't fold laundry, catch up on your favorite shows, sneak in a nap or anything else you'd do on a day off.  No one can see what you're doing so you will be judged on your output/results, and if you're sluffing off the workday it'll show.  I'm not saying you have to be chained to your desk all day and avoid doing things like checking Reddit (lol), but the bulk of your workday needs to be spent there.

As the others said, work extra hard at communicating so you're still heard.  Schedule regular 1:1s with teammates and your boss, participate in team calls, and touch base during the day with relevant IMs.  

For me, though, the most overlooked factor is managerial support.  You can have the best plan, work your hardest, and deliver quality &amp; timely results, but if the boss or the organization doesn't fully support you being remote then nothing else matters.  Some managers just don't know how to manage employees they can't see, and some aren't willing to learn.  Thankfully this doesn't sound like your case.

From the eyes of the person recruiting they just want to constantly be reassured that you are the right person to deliver the work that they need so to be able to actively demonstrate the exact skills a role is looking for is very important. 

Being able to offer a spread of skills is also very important. It looks to me like your skillset is focused mainly on backend web development at the moment and I think that being able to say you have some experience with something like ReactJS on the frontend would be a big selling point to separate you from other applicants. 

I run a website called [JustRemote.co](https://JustRemote.co) which promotes remote working positions. One thing I have noticed is that the majority of companies offering remote work at the moment are start-up's and small businesses. These companies often have fewer than 20 employees and as a result are looking for people who can offer a range of skills and are able to switch roles. Effectively the more skills you can offer companies like these the more chance you have of securing a role. 

In summary I would therefore do the following: 

1. Create a strong portfolio of well written code
2. If you can, try to display your portfolio in a visually appealing way (if you're design skills aren't great then something like [squarespace.com](https://squarespace.com) might be able to help).
3. Continue to develop your skillset with the aim of eventually becoming a full stack developer as then you'll be offering most value. 
4. Ensure your applications are well written, clear and considered.
5. Try to build a network of connections with other people in development. Referrals from an actual person are incredibly powerful and so attending start up events, dev meet ups etc can be very useful. 

I think it's especially hard when you're coming fresh from University as you have less work to back you up but don't give up! It's a numbers game and you will only need a single position to establish yourself as a remote worker in the eyes of future employees. 

Another option if remote work doesn't seem to work would be to try and work for a company like [Cognizant](https://www.cognizant.com/en-uk/). I'm not sure where in India you're from but i've worked with many Indian developers in the UK all of which came over as consultants through Cognizant. This experience would help give strong credibility to your applications and it also allows you to build up a network of people who in the future may be able to offer you work. ","2"

Currently I am being turned down by almost 28-35 interviews and that seems because I'm a fresher or they don't want me to pay high. I certainly agree on your point of going through referrals is a really high chance. But somehow my batchmates are not even telling me that which sites are they using to find remote jobs. Though, you and others here have already mentioned really amazing options. So yeah I currently feel numb as I am not getting any offers but yeah that one single position would add so much to my credibility or that's what I'm hopeful for.

And yes I'm bad at designing, because logic always comes first to my mind, but I would try to be minimalistic I guess and learn the design anyways. Do suggest something on that spot.

I am from Gujarat State ( west coast of India ). I really hate those consultant companies because they only hire fresh people out from college without even looking at their degree and then just put them to figure out excel sheets for clients. And their pay is less as well ~ US$360 per Month ( here we mostly call them Mass Recruiter ) So even after working there one would not grow much as a developer.

There's a wide selection of answers to your question it all depends on which path you want to go.  

One that may be a quicker route would be like a Software Analyst (support analyst or support engineer).  I did that for a while remotely and saw a decent amount of positions out there.  They vary in what they seek but from my past positions learning some SQL and focusing on your customer service skills would be a good way into that.  I know you said you don't have the background but if it's something you want to pursue you can still discuss your people skills.  Also possibly learning to read code (C#, C++ or Java to begin with) on a high level.  You would have to take a little bit of a paycut likely though.  

Other positions are out there but all vary in how long it takes to acquire the skills one needs to be qualified for them.  If you want to change careers to a different direction then that's a very different question.

Yeah I haven't been looking too long I just started searching and have been somewhat discouraged by the results. Some of the previous posts have indicated that if you don't have a programming background then it may be too late to start in that direction.

I have signed up for a few udemy courses to kind of get a basic understanding of certain programming languages, although reading code seems generally pretty simple so long as you think logically (I had taken c++ in HS) and I'm also studying for my ccnp (hoping I can get my ccie in the next year or two). A career change is not out of the question but I've never liked being in sales which seems to be the easiest telecommuting job to get into.

I've always wanted to start my own business but never really been an idea guy, I've always been more of an execution type person ","1_1"

Something in software is going to be the easiest thing to land.  Pick a general field and just go after it and you'll land something.  I've had a couple of positions that began as in office jobs that later transitioned to remote too so be on the lookout for those.

There are a number of companies in the tech sector looking for consultants who work remotely and are open to travel and live near a major airport. For example, with the network certifications, would it be easier to find jobs with software companies in your field (Cisco, Dell, NetApp, EMC etc)? 

You've probably used software from several vendors, and you can speak to those products as a subject matter expert. This route is an easier way to get into that first telecommuting job.  Play up your tech skills, your soft skills and position yourself as an independent person who can manage your own time - in that order.

You are competing with a much larger pool of able workers if you're just applying to positions that are publicly posted as remote positions (vs local in-office jobs)

One approach I would recommend is applying to local jobs and negotiating 1 day per week as a WFH. It is critical to get this up front. As time passes and you prove that you remain productive at home, you can typically increase the number of days. I've done this at two different jobs and I have a friend who managed to be 100% remote within 1 year. ","1"

Unwitty is right that it is easier to find a local company that will let you work remote occasionally than to find a fully remote job, it's not impossible to find a real remote job however. I did so, but truthfully it took me about 6 months of applying and interviewing (while I was employed in a non-remote job) before I got one.

At your experience level, you'll need a top-notch resume and very good interviewing skills to land one, make sure to constantly work on those, it will also help a lot if you're currently employed, so I would advise against quitting your job before having another one lined up. 

Other than that, be patient, it may takes a few weeks, or it may take a year, remote positions are still extremely competitive for now so your profile really does need to stand out AND you need to apply to a lot of positions before you'll find the right one.

If you're able to get an interview, you're probably qualified to do the job.

The problem must boil down to either (1) what you're saying, or (2) how you're saying it. 

If it's the first one, research the company, people and competitors very thoroughly (I sell an e-book that helps with this, but if you invest 2-3 hours in learning about everything and writing short notes and questions, you should be okay). 

If it's the second one - HOW you're saying things - that is a bigger problem. People interviewing want you to be able to communicate clearly, see that you listen carefully, that you're a nice person to be around, that you're enthusiastic about what you do and what the company does, that you're trustworthy, etc. Consider joining a Toastmasters club and investing time in speaking better.

Everybody on your team should answer these questions every day (a 5 min conf call, automated email, automated message - implement it however works best).

* What did you do yesterday?
* What are you going to do today?
* Is there anything impeding / blocking your progress?

I encouraged them to reach out to eachother for help -- but no,  the same expectation was not made of them. Their primary focus was to be productive and get their own work done. We worked remotely and were very flexible with our hours, so I didn't even mandate that they showed as ""available"" in Slack.

That said, some people needed more monitoring than others -- and I'd get on their case more if they showed as offline for 75% of the day.

The nice thing about Slack is that it's basically like text messages. While I was able to respond quickly to help unblock things for them -- we had a mutual understanding that if they were in the middle of a complex task they could wait to reply to me until they ""came up for air"".

I favor ""Maker time"" in a big way -- but like I mentioned before, it only works for a great employee who isn't going to take advantage. The rest have to be addressed head on.","3_1_1"

My team all gets along pretty well and we all connect easily on different interests, plus as a lead for the team I'm very much their cheerleader (sounds dumb but!!) so we're all comfortable supporting and celebrating each other.","4"

If we have the time, we use Slack to spare a few minutes checking in on others, but we mostly respect their time.

We get more social on Fridays, because weekend. The morning meetings are a bit more informal and if everyone's not extremely drained out, we have gaming sessions at the end of the day.

Screenshare constantly.  You're a developer?  Does your team do pair programming?  Offer to pair with people whenever possible.","2"

You're working from home, not at home while you work. 8-5, 9-6, whatever your hours are are your work hours.  Don't fold laundry, catch up on your favorite shows, sneak in a nap or anything else you'd do on a day off.  No one can see what you're doing so you will be judged on your output/results, and if you're sluffing off the workday it'll show.  I'm not saying you have to be chained to your desk all day and avoid doing things like checking Reddit (lol), but the bulk of your workday needs to be spent there.

As the others said, work extra hard at communicating so you're still heard.  Schedule regular 1:1s with teammates and your boss, participate in team calls, and touch base during the day with relevant IMs.  

For me, though, the most overlooked factor is managerial support.  You can have the best plan, work your hardest, and deliver quality &amp; timely results, but if the boss or the organization doesn't fully support you being remote then nothing else matters.  Some managers just don't know how to manage employees they can't see, and some aren't willing to learn.  Thankfully this doesn't sound like your case.  Those teams who are committed to telecommuting are the ones who make it work best.","3"

From the eyes of the person recruiting they just want to constantly be reassured that you are the right person to deliver the work that they need so to be able to actively demonstrate the exact skills a role is looking for is very important. 

Being able to offer a spread of skills is also very important. It looks to me like your skillset is focused mainly on backend web development at the moment and I think that being able to say you have some experience with something like ReactJS on the frontend would be a big selling point to separate you from other applicants. 

I run a website called [JustRemote.co](https://JustRemote.co) which promotes remote working positions. One thing I have noticed is that the majority of companies offering remote work at the moment are start-up's and small businesses. These companies often have fewer than 20 employees and as a result are looking for people who can offer a range of skills and are able to switch roles. Effectively the more skills you can offer companies like these the more chance you have of securing a role. 

In summary I would therefore do the following: 

1. Create a strong portfolio of well written code
2. If you can, try to display your portfolio in a visually appealing way (if you're design skills aren't great then something like [squarespace.com](https://squarespace.com) might be able to help).
3. Continue to develop your skillset with the aim of eventually becoming a full stack developer as then you'll be offering most value. 
4. Ensure your applications are well written, clear and considered.
5. Try to build a network of connections with other people in development. Referrals from an actual person are incredibly powerful and so attending start up events, dev meet ups etc can be very useful. 

I think it's especially hard when you're coming fresh from University as you have less work to back you up but don't give up! It's a numbers game and you will only need a single position to establish yourself as a remote worker in the eyes of future employees. 

Another option if remote work doesn't seem to work would be to try and work for a company like [Cognizant](https://www.cognizant.com/en-uk/). I'm not sure where in India you're from but i've worked with many Indian developers in the UK all of which came over as consultants through Cognizant. This experience would help give strong credibility to your applications and it also allows you to build up a network of people who in the future may be able to offer you work. ","2"

Currently I am being turned down by almost 28-35 interviews and that seems because I'm a fresher or they don't want me to pay high. I certainly agree on your point of going through referrals is a really high chance. But somehow my batchmates are not even telling me that which sites are they using to find remote jobs. Though, you and others here have already mentioned really amazing options. So yeah I currently feel numb as I am not getting any offers but yeah that one single position would add so much to my credibility or that's what I'm hopeful for.

And yes I'm bad at designing, because logic always comes first to my mind, but I would try to be minimalistic I guess and learn the design anyways. Do suggest something on that spot.

I am from Gujarat State ( west coast of India ). I really hate those consultant companies because they only hire fresh people out from college without even looking at their degree and then just put them to figure out excel sheets for clients. And their pay is less as well ~ US$360 per Month ( here we mostly call them Mass Recruiter ) So even after working there one would not grow much as a developer.

I'm hopeful and every evening I think of quiting but I won't, comments/posts like yours really increases my health bar again. Thank you.

One that may be a quicker route would be like a Software Analyst (support analyst or support engineer).  I did that for a while remotely and saw a decent amount of positions out there.  They vary in what they seek but from my past positions learning some SQL and focusing on your customer service skills would be a good way into that.  I know you said you don't have the background but if it's something you want to pursue you can still discuss your people skills.  Also possibly learning to read code (C#, C++ or Java to begin with) on a high level.  You would have to take a little bit of a paycut likely though.  

Other positions are out there but all vary in how long it takes to acquire the skills one needs to be qualified for them.  If you want to change careers to a different direction then that's a very different question.

You are competing with a much larger pool of able workers if you're just applying to positions that are publicly posted as remote positions (vs local in-office jobs)

One approach I would recommend is applying to local jobs and negotiating 1 day per week as a WFH. It is critical to get this up front. As time passes and you prove that you remain productive at home, you can typically increase the number of days. I've done this at two different jobs and I have a friend who managed to be 100% remote within 1 year. ","1"

Unwitty is right that it is easier to find a local company that will let you work remote occasionally than to find a fully remote job, it's not impossible to find a real remote job however. I did so, but truthfully it took me about 6 months of applying and interviewing (while I was employed in a non-remote job) before I got one.

At your experience level, you'll need a top-notch resume and very good interviewing skills to land one, make sure to constantly work on those, it will also help a lot if you're currently employed, so I would advise against quitting your job before having another one lined up. 

Other than that, be patient, it may takes a few weeks, or it may take a year, remote positions are still extremely competitive for now so your profile really does need to stand out AND you need to apply to a lot of positions before you'll find the right one.

If you're able to get an interview, you're probably qualified to do the job.

The problem must boil down to either (1) what you're saying, or (2) how you're saying it. 

If it's the first one, research the company, people and competitors very thoroughly (I sell an e-book that helps with this, but if you invest 2-3 hours in learning about everything and writing short notes and questions, you should be okay). 

If it's the second one - HOW you're saying things - that is a bigger problem. People interviewing want you to be able to communicate clearly, see that you listen carefully, that you're a nice person to be around, that you're enthusiastic about what you do and what the company does, that you're trustworthy, etc. Consider joining a Toastmasters club and investing time in speaking better.

I encouraged them to reach out to eachother for help -- but no,  the same expectation was not made of them. Their primary focus was to be productive and get their own work done. We worked remotely and were very flexible with our hours, so I didn't even mandate that they showed as ""available"" in Slack.

That said, some people needed more monitoring than others -- and I'd get on their case more if they showed as offline for 75% of the day.

The nice thing about Slack is that it's basically like text messages. While I was able to respond quickly to help unblock things for them -- we had a mutual understanding that if they were in the middle of a complex task they could wait to reply to me until they ""came up for air"".

I'm based out of my home and made the transition to remote about three years ago. If you can demonstrate an ability to do your work without supervision and get your stuff done then you can make the transition. For some people it's a difficult transition, but for others it is very satisfying.

Being a software developer provides a greater opportunity for you to find remote work, because the work can be done anywhere, as long as it gets done. 

I don't think I could ever go back to working full-time in a corporate environment.

Also more likely to be able to monitor the work if you're doing the work on the laptop and just using your personal computer to remote into it (just monitoring the laptop work, not the personal computer side). If you're doing work 100% on your personal computer, it's unlikely your work laptop would be set up to try and gain access to that, but in that case, why would the laptop be involved in the first place (unless it's acting as a data store only or something).

Mostly, it would depend on (a) whether the laptop can see the office network, and (b) whether anything you're doing on your personal computer is using the laptop as an internet access point or network switch.

With that being said, have you checked out [https://weworkremotely.com/](https://weworkremotely.com/)? Are you willing to do semi-remote?

Maybe you can consider being a consultant for the big 4 (Pricewaterhouse Cooper, Accenture). Work isnt remote but you travel a lot around the US or abroad and not going into the same office for more than a couple months each time.

What could make a difference is the number of facilities that accept a particular insurance company in your city vs another city in the middle of nowhere. Just make sure you confirm that for your new policy that you plan to buy, there are enough in-network doctors, hospitals etc in your desired location. Then if you buy it and you move to a new location, I believe that qualifies as a life event so you could change insurances and get better coverage for your new location (if the original one is not good enough in the new location).

http://ehealthinsurance.com sells private insurance plans. You can get UHC, BCBS, Kaiser etc. Now there is http://healthcare.gov as well.

Aside from that, a manager should strive to find the right tools that allow the team to have good communication without adding too much overhead in day to day usage. A lot of managers or project managers may disagree, but the job is still about programming rather than reporting in on things.

I would say it really depends on how much bureaucracy the company is willing to handle to have you. All my contractor friends from Poland do B2B for Germany/USA based companies. From taxation point of view for programmers it has lots of benefits in PL. Dunno about CZ.

&gt; bank credit for mortgage

Obviously I can only speak from my PL experience, but being self-employed was never an issue. 

For mortgage I think they needed 1 or 2 years of income data, and for smaller loans they don't want anything at all or 3 months.","1_1_1"

Not quite - you are in principle liable to pay taxes in your country of residence; however, your employer is liable to retain and pay tax advances on your behalf in the country of employement, which you can then deduct from your own taxes (that last bit is the laws preventing double taxation at work). So, for example, suppose you work for a Dutch company as a German resident; then your Dutch employer applied Dutch law, reducing your salary by the legally required amount (about 35%); then when you file your German taxes, you can deduct any taxes already paid in the Netherlands from your German tax statement.

That's the theory.

In practice, the bureacracies involved are not at all prepared to handle this kind of thing smoothly - telecommuting is still a bit of a fringe thing, and a fairly new phenomenon at that, after all. So if you do thing like this, it can get ugly fast, so I'd recommend against.

A much easier solution is usually to go through a payroll company in your country of residence, who will act as your pro forma employer. So what happens then is that your real employer ""buys"" your labor from the payroll company; this is an international B2B transaction, which is a very common and well-regulated thing. The payroll company then applied your local law, just like a local employer would, taking care of all sorts of tax and social security payments, and providing you with all the paperwork you need to do your own taxes. As far as the tax office is concerned, you are employed in your own country, so this part will go just as smoothly as any other job. The only downside is that the payroll company won't provide this service for free, so it's a good idea to discuss these things with your employer upfront.

Another alternative is to act as a self-employed entrepreneur; then instead of receiving a salary, you invoice the agreed-upon amount, and your employer pays you like they would pay any other business internationally. You are then responsible to act as your own employer, and paying whatever is due according to local law. This comes at the expense of more paperwork on your side however, and you don't automatically qualify for this under all circumstances in all countries. Probably worth checking with a local expert if you want to take this route.","2"

If you really start feeling socially isolated in general, check out meetup.com and find a couple of interesting groups to attend related to work.","2"

I've been working 100% remote for the last three years. There are some definite advantages, but one of the possible disadvantages is isolation. However there are a few things you can do to mitigate this:

1.) Stay in contact with your colleagues as much as possible, via instant message, video meetings, email and phone. Don't be reluctant to bounce ideas / bond socially over these mediums. Everyone else on your team needs this interaction and you'll find the bond can become greater between you and your colleagues as a result of these efforts.

2.) Get out of the house as much as possible. You can become isolated working alone if you don't take the necessary steps to get out and do activities you enjoy outside of your home office / workplace. Do the necessary things you need to with the important people in your life. Also, go work in a coffee shop one day a week - you'll have the ""buzz"" of a good coffee and people around you. 

3.) Whenever possible, set your own schedule and stick to it. Since you work at home, the lines between work and home can become blurred. Set the proper expectations with your boss, co-workers and clients. As long as you get your stuff done that's all that matters. That's part of the flexibility of being a remote worker. 

I say embrace it. It's cool your employer allows its workers to be remote, especially in the tech sector. Obviously they've put their trust in you to work from home and make the most of it!  

Good luck!","3"

The initial concept/idea behind this startup was to replace your mortgage with subscription based housing.  Basically you would be sacrificing your mortgage in exchange for the opportunity to live anywhere in our so-called network of housing.

We are still researching costs and refining the business model based on the ongoing customer validation and feedback we have been getting so none of this is finite right now.  However, what we have found so far does push the concept that it would be hard to make this an affordable option if you have both a mortgage/lease and our subscription model.  We've found that most people are willing to spend approximately 1.5k a month for this service.  I know that me personally could not afford that on top of my mortgage.

You do bring up a very valid point which is, what do I do if I have a mortgage and other commitments that keep me in one location on a regular basis.  I believe that ideally you could still subscribe to this network but you would basically be paying the subscription every month to stay in housing in your current location but this would also allow you to travel within the network more or less on demand as other housing is available.

One benefit with this concept for people we've talked in a similar situation as yourself is related to vacationing.  If you are paying for the subscription you would be able to travel and stay at any location in our network which basically means that if you live in Seattle but want to vacation in Denver, you could find housing available in Denver during the dates you want to be on vacation and wouldn't have to pay extra.  When you normally would be paying your mortgage as well as rooms at hotels/airbnb's, the subscription would cut out the vacation housing.

I would love to hear your thoughts on this response and any feedback/questions would be greatly appreciated.  ","4_1"

Yes, we have ideas and a business plan in place that caters more to the digital nomad who has already chosen to travel on an undetermined basis but we really want to hear what anyone who wants to talk to us thinks.

To bluntly answer your question, yes.  That was the initial concept.  That may turn you off.  I have a mortgage, a wife and 2 children right now so I may somewhat be able to relate to you.  If that's a total turnoff, let me know and let me know specifically why.  If its not or its up in air, let me know how.

We've been getting a lot of feedback over the past week and have identified a lot of pain points for many people but we are still trying to collect as much data as we can moving forward.  

It's hard to move your family and give up your mortgage but the trade off with a concept like this could be worth it.  It may not be.  I'm not asking you to sell your mortgage, I want to know what it would take to make you do that.","4_1_1_1"

What works is that just 1-2 decent places in a small town (or 5-6 in a big city) are enough to make the list useful. Reddit allows proper updates and commenting, and the reviews feel far more honest and personal than those on a generic review website (in case of r/Thailand they may even be from people I know personally). 

The downside, of course, is that you can't make money, and that you're constrained to Reddit format and can only suggest guidelines (that people may not follow).

A full website is a tricky matter... it raises the bar significantly, and will only work with a large critical mass of reviews. If I go to a website and see less than 3 reviews for a town I search for, I leave immediately.

You're working from home, not at home while you work. 8-5, 9-6, whatever your hours are are your work hours.  Don't fold laundry, catch up on your favorite shows, sneak in a nap or anything else you'd do on a day off.  No one can see what you're doing so you will be judged on your output/results, and if you're sluffing off the workday it'll show.  I'm not saying you have to be chained to your desk all day and avoid doing things like checking Reddit (lol), but the bulk of your workday needs to be spent there.

As the others said, work extra hard at communicating so you're still heard.  Schedule regular 1:1s with teammates and your boss, participate in team calls, and touch base during the day with relevant IMs.  

For me, though, the most overlooked factor is managerial support.  You can have the best plan, work your hardest, and deliver quality &amp; timely results, but if the boss or the organization doesn't fully support you being remote then nothing else matters.  Some managers just don't know how to manage employees they can't see, and some aren't willing to learn.  Thankfully this doesn't sound like your case.

From the eyes of the person recruiting they just want to constantly be reassured that you are the right person to deliver the work that they need so to be able to actively demonstrate the exact skills a role is looking for is very important. 

Being able to offer a spread of skills is also very important. It looks to me like your skillset is focused mainly on backend web development at the moment and I think that being able to say you have some experience with something like ReactJS on the frontend would be a big selling point to separate you from other applicants. 

I run a website called [JustRemote.co](https://JustRemote.co) which promotes remote working positions. One thing I have noticed is that the majority of companies offering remote work at the moment are start-up's and small businesses. These companies often have fewer than 20 employees and as a result are looking for people who can offer a range of skills and are able to switch roles. Effectively the more skills you can offer companies like these the more chance you have of securing a role. 

In summary I would therefore do the following: 

1. Create a strong portfolio of well written code
2. If you can, try to display your portfolio in a visually appealing way (if you're design skills aren't great then something like [squarespace.com](https://squarespace.com) might be able to help).
3. Continue to develop your skillset with the aim of eventually becoming a full stack developer as then you'll be offering most value. 
4. Ensure your applications are well written, clear and considered.
5. Try to build a network of connections with other people in development. Referrals from an actual person are incredibly powerful and so attending start up events, dev meet ups etc can be very useful. 

I think it's especially hard when you're coming fresh from University as you have less work to back you up but don't give up! It's a numbers game and you will only need a single position to establish yourself as a remote worker in the eyes of future employees. 

Another option if remote work doesn't seem to work would be to try and work for a company like [Cognizant](https://www.cognizant.com/en-uk/). I'm not sure where in India you're from but i've worked with many Indian developers in the UK all of which came over as consultants through Cognizant. This experience would help give strong credibility to your applications and it also allows you to build up a network of people who in the future may be able to offer you work. ","2"

Currently I am being turned down by almost 28-35 interviews and that seems because I'm a fresher or they don't want me to pay high. I certainly agree on your point of going through referrals is a really high chance. But somehow my batchmates are not even telling me that which sites are they using to find remote jobs. Though, you and others here have already mentioned really amazing options. So yeah I currently feel numb as I am not getting any offers but yeah that one single position would add so much to my credibility or that's what I'm hopeful for.

And yes I'm bad at designing, because logic always comes first to my mind, but I would try to be minimalistic I guess and learn the design anyways. Do suggest something on that spot.

I am from Gujarat State ( west coast of India ). I really hate those consultant companies because they only hire fresh people out from college without even looking at their degree and then just put them to figure out excel sheets for clients. And their pay is less as well ~ US$360 per Month ( here we mostly call them Mass Recruiter ) So even after working there one would not grow much as a developer.

There's a wide selection of answers to your question it all depends on which path you want to go.  

One that may be a quicker route would be like a Software Analyst (support analyst or support engineer).  I did that for a while remotely and saw a decent amount of positions out there.  They vary in what they seek but from my past positions learning some SQL and focusing on your customer service skills would be a good way into that.  I know you said you don't have the background but if it's something you want to pursue you can still discuss your people skills.  Also possibly learning to read code (C#, C++ or Java to begin with) on a high level.  You would have to take a little bit of a paycut likely though.  

Other positions are out there but all vary in how long it takes to acquire the skills one needs to be qualified for them.  If you want to change careers to a different direction then that's a very different question.

Yeah I haven't been looking too long I just started searching and have been somewhat discouraged by the results. Some of the previous posts have indicated that if you don't have a programming background then it may be too late to start in that direction.

I have signed up for a few udemy courses to kind of get a basic understanding of certain programming languages, although reading code seems generally pretty simple so long as you think logically (I had taken c++ in HS) and I'm also studying for my ccnp (hoping I can get my ccie in the next year or two). A career change is not out of the question but I've never liked being in sales which seems to be the easiest telecommuting job to get into.

I've always wanted to start my own business but never really been an idea guy, I've always been more of an execution type person ","1_1"

Something in software is going to be the easiest thing to land.  Pick a general field and just go after it and you'll land something.  I've had a couple of positions that began as in office jobs that later transitioned to remote too so be on the lookout for those.  One was with a small startup and the other was with a company that had a 1 year contract at a clients' site that I was hired to fill.  After that year they kept me on remotely.

As a tech professional I wouldn't sell yourself short. There are a number of companies in the tech sector looking for consultants who work remotely and are open to travel and live near a major airport. For example, with the network certifications, would it be easier to find jobs with software companies in your field (Cisco, Dell, NetApp, EMC etc)? 

You've probably used software from several vendors, and you can speak to those products as a subject matter expert. This route is an easier way to get into that first telecommuting job.  Play up your tech skills, your soft skills and position yourself as an independent person who can manage your own time - in that order.

You are competing with a much larger pool of able workers if you're just applying to positions that are publicly posted as remote positions (vs local in-office jobs)

One approach I would recommend is applying to local jobs and negotiating 1 day per week as a WFH. It is critical to get this up front. As time passes and you prove that you remain productive at home, you can typically increase the number of days. I've done this at two different jobs and I have a friend who managed to be 100% remote within 1 year. ","1"

Unwitty is right that it is easier to find a local company that will let you work remote occasionally than to find a fully remote job, it's not impossible to find a real remote job however. I did so, but truthfully it took me about 6 months of applying and interviewing (while I was employed in a non-remote job) before I got one.

At your experience level, you'll need a top-notch resume and very good interviewing skills to land one, make sure to constantly work on those, it will also help a lot if you're currently employed, so I would advise against quitting your job before having another one lined up. 

Other than that, be patient, it may takes a few weeks, or it may take a year, remote positions are still extremely competitive for now so your profile really does need to stand out AND you need to apply to a lot of positions before you'll find the right one.

If you're able to get an interview, you're probably qualified to do the job.

The problem must boil down to either (1) what you're saying, or (2) how you're saying it. 

If it's the first one, research the company, people and competitors very thoroughly (I sell an e-book that helps with this, but if you invest 2-3 hours in learning about everything and writing short notes and questions, you should be okay). 

If it's the second one - HOW you're saying things - that is a bigger problem. People interviewing want you to be able to communicate clearly, see that you listen carefully, that you're a nice person to be around, that you're enthusiastic about what you do and what the company does, that you're trustworthy, etc. Consider joining a Toastmasters club and investing time in speaking better.

Reason I ask is that is I'm wary that although as a manager I can be most useful if I can answer the team's questions quickly and unblock them, that I don't want to be constantly interrupting them if they are deep in work that requires concentration.

I encouraged them to reach out to eachother for help -- but no,  the same expectation was not made of them. Their primary focus was to be productive and get their own work done. We worked remotely and were very flexible with our hours, so I didn't even mandate that they showed as ""available"" in Slack.

That said, some people needed more monitoring than others -- and I'd get on their case more if they showed as offline for 75% of the day.

The nice thing about Slack is that it's basically like text messages. While I was able to respond quickly to help unblock things for them -- we had a mutual understanding that if they were in the middle of a complex task they could wait to reply to me until they ""came up for air"".

I favor ""Maker time"" in a big way -- but like I mentioned before, it only works for a great employee who isn't going to take advantage. The rest have to be addressed head on.","3_1_1"

Moreso if the work laptop is connecting to the office through a VPN or something, but in theory it could also be set up to capture traffic to local storage and narc on you once it's reconnected to the office.

Also more likely to be able to monitor the work if you're doing the work on the laptop and just using your personal computer to remote into it (just monitoring the laptop work, not the personal computer side). If you're doing work 100% on your personal computer, it's unlikely your work laptop would be set up to try and gain access to that, but in that case, why would the laptop be involved in the first place (unless it's acting as a data store only or something).

Mostly, it would depend on (a) whether the laptop can see the office network, and (b) whether anything you're doing on your personal computer is using the laptop as an internet access point or network switch.

Depending on the work, they might as well look for a freelancer or hire a remote person for cheap abroad. 

With that being said, have you checked out [https://weworkremotely.com/](https://weworkremotely.com/)? Are you willing to do semi-remote? Companies that are ok with remote work are normally tech companies and tech startups. Getting any job in general is tough for a new grad. And start taking extra courses from an MOOC (edX, Udacity, Udemy) that are digitally focused. Whatever it may be, like learning about data visualization, machine learning, etc. The reality is that you might have to settle with doing non-remote for the first few years to build up your reputation and skill set for any company to trust hiring someone who is generalized. Doesnt matter what college you came from. 

Maybe you can consider being a consultant for the big 4 (Pricewaterhouse Cooper, Accenture). Work isnt remote but you travel a lot around the US or abroad and not going into the same office for more than a couple months each time.

Other option is looking for fellow graduating students who are looking to partner with someone on a startup. Just have to talk your way in. Only thing is you wont have a salary for at least a few years as a cofounder because its a startup.","1"

There's a big difference between walking past a coworker and striking a random conversation about a project you're working on, or asking your manager for feedback in person, than doing it all behind a screen.

What could make a difference is the number of facilities that accept a particular insurance company in your city vs another city in the middle of nowhere. Just make sure you confirm that for your new policy that you plan to buy, there are enough in-network doctors, hospitals etc in your desired location. Then if you buy it and you move to a new location, I believe that qualifies as a life event so you could change insurances and get better coverage for your new location (if the original one is not good enough in the new location).

http://ehealthinsurance.com sells private insurance plans. You can get UHC, BCBS, Kaiser etc. Now there is http://healthcare.gov as well.

That might be possible with an EU employer but much harder if you try to work for an US based company. I would say it really depends on how much bureaucracy the company is willing to handle to have you. All my contractor friends from Poland do B2B for Germany/USA based companies. From taxation point of view for programmers it has lots of benefits in PL. Dunno about CZ.

&gt; bank credit for mortgage

Obviously I can only speak from my PL experience, but being self-employed was never an issue. 

For mortgage I think they needed 1 or 2 years of income data, and for smaller loans they don't want anything at all or 3 months.","1_1_1"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/telecommuting/comments/9ob1x5/telecommuting_and_gross_vs_net_income/","tdammers","2018-10-15",1539613064,3,3,0,0,"&gt; From what I understand, the tax will be calculated in the country of the employer.

Not quite - you are in principle liable to pay taxes in your country of residence; however, your employer is liable to retain and pay tax advances on your behalf in the country of employement, which you can then deduct from your own taxes (that last bit is the laws preventing double taxation at work). So, for example, suppose you work for a Dutch company as a German resident; then your Dutch employer applied Dutch law, reducing your salary by the legally required amount (about 35%); then when you file your German taxes, you can deduct any taxes already paid in the Netherlands from your German tax statement.

That's the theory.

In practice, the bureacracies involved are not at all prepared to handle this kind of thing smoothly - telecommuting is still a bit of a fringe thing, and a fairly new phenomenon at that, after all. So if you do thing like this, it can get ugly fast, so I'd recommend against.

A much easier solution is usually to go through a payroll company in your country of residence, who will act as your pro forma employer. So what happens then is that your real employer ""buys"" your labor from the payroll company; this is an international B2B transaction, which is a very common and well-regulated thing. The payroll company then applied your local law, just like a local employer would, taking care of all sorts of tax and social security payments, and providing you with all the paperwork you need to do your own taxes. As far as the tax office is concerned, you are employed in your own country, so this part will go just as smoothly as any other job. The only downside is that the payroll company won't provide this service for free, so it's a good idea to discuss these things with your employer upfront.

Another alternative is to act as a self-employed entrepreneur; then instead of receiving a salary, you invoice the agreed-upon amount, and your employer pays you like they would pay any other business internationally. You are then responsible to act as your own employer, and paying whatever is due according to local law. This comes at the expense of more paperwork on your side however, and you don't automatically qualify for this under all circumstances in all countries. Probably worth checking with a local expert if you want to take this route.","2"

I've been working 100% remote for the last three years. There are some definite advantages, but one of the possible disadvantages is isolation. However there are a few things you can do to mitigate this:

1.) Stay in contact with your colleagues as much as possible, via instant message, video meetings, email and phone. Don't be reluctant to bounce ideas / bond socially over these mediums. Everyone else on your team needs this interaction and you'll find the bond can become greater between you and your colleagues as a result of these efforts.

2.) Get out of the house as much as possible. You can become isolated working alone if you don't take the necessary steps to get out and do activities you enjoy outside of your home office / workplace. Do the necessary things you need to with the important people in your life. Also, go work in a coffee shop one day a week - you'll have the ""buzz"" of a good coffee and people around you. 

3.) Whenever possible, set your own schedule and stick to it. Since you work at home, the lines between work and home can become blurred. Set the proper expectations with your boss, co-workers and clients. As long as you get your stuff done that's all that matters. That's part of the flexibility of being a remote worker. 

I say embrace it. It's cool your employer allows its workers to be remote, especially in the tech sector. Obviously they've put their trust in you to work from home and make the most of it!

The initial concept/idea behind this startup was to replace your mortgage with subscription based housing.  Basically you would be sacrificing your mortgage in exchange for the opportunity to live anywhere in our so-called network of housing.

We are still researching costs and refining the business model based on the ongoing customer validation and feedback we have been getting so none of this is finite right now.  However, what we have found so far does push the concept that it would be hard to make this an affordable option if you have both a mortgage/lease and our subscription model.  We've found that most people are willing to spend approximately 1.5k a month for this service.  I know that me personally could not afford that on top of my mortgage.

You do bring up a very valid point which is, what do I do if I have a mortgage and other commitments that keep me in one location on a regular basis.  I believe that ideally you could still subscribe to this network but you would basically be paying the subscription every month to stay in housing in your current location but this would also allow you to travel within the network more or less on demand as other housing is available.

One benefit with this concept for people we've talked in a similar situation as yourself is related to vacationing.  If you are paying for the subscription you would be able to travel and stay at any location in our network which basically means that if you live in Seattle but want to vacation in Denver, you could find housing available in Denver during the dates you want to be on vacation and wouldn't have to pay extra.  When you normally would be paying your mortgage as well as rooms at hotels/airbnb's, the subscription would cut out the vacation housing.

I would love to hear your thoughts on this response and any feedback/questions would be greatly appreciated.  ","4_1"

To bluntly answer your question, yes.  That was the initial concept.  That may turn you off.  I have a mortgage, a wife and 2 children right now so I may somewhat be able to relate to you.  If that's a total turnoff, let me know and let me know specifically why.  If its not or its up in air, let me know how.

We've been getting a lot of feedback over the past week and have identified a lot of pain points for many people but we are still trying to collect as much data as we can moving forward.

What works is that just 1-2 decent places in a small town (or 5-6 in a big city) are enough to make the list useful. Reddit allows proper updates and commenting, and the reviews feel far more honest and personal than those on a generic review website (in case of r/Thailand they may even be from people I know personally). 

The downside, of course, is that you can't make money, and that you're constrained to Reddit format and can only suggest guidelines (that people may not follow).

A full website is a tricky matter... it raises the bar significantly, and will only work with a large critical mass of reviews. If I go to a website and see less than 3 reviews for a town I search for, I leave immediately.

Problem I see with this is that there will be subsets of people within your group of 50 that want to go to different places at different times.  If you've ever assembled a large group of 10 or more friends to go on a vacation or trip, then what you generally might find is that people will splinter apart to suit their own interests.  For example, some people want to be near the beach, some want to be in a coworking space in the city, some may want to travel to rural areas, some to metropolitan areas, etc...

Now if you vet this out in the beginning and everybody who signs up agrees to this, then you're good to go.","2"

The main emphasis is on building a community of travelers who are also working. That is the added benefit. There are lots of ""Digital Nomad"" out there who spend a month in Thailand then two months in Vietnam etc... But when you do this alone you don't really make lasting personal or professional connections. Yes, you might hangout with someone you met at the hostel a few nights a week, but then, as you said, they have a different schedule, and they leave for another location. 

So yes, people would have to buy into the locations. Half the battle is finding quality locations that a group of people want to go to. This is the same challenge Vacation Tour Companies have. Companies like TopDeck or Abercrombie &amp; Kent put together tours of all different locations and hope/entice people sign up. They don't ask 25 people what they would like to do b.c you never get agreement. You also will get variety with this. So, one month we might be on a beach in Bali and the next in the Thai city of Chang Mai. People like myself and the types of people I am looking to attract don't really care where they are as long as it is somewhere new and different. It's not about going to Croatia for a month; its about experiencing Croatia with a group of people while you are working. 

I am also considering changing my 4 month minimum to a one month minimum. This way if someone doesn't like a location they can skip it and join the group at the next location. Or if they like a location they can stay and join back up at a future location. But again the point of this is to build a community that people won't want to leave. ","2_1"

My current manager lets me own my work. I rarely ever get bothered by him. He'll just ask if I saw a comment related to my work in a Slack channel occasionally. This is largely because he has his own work to do in addition to management.

My previous manager was more of a micro-manager and she went looking for work even when there really wasn't much to do. The problem was that she had two reports and nothing else to do.

&gt; What competencies did you wish your manager had that they did not?

Nothing. He's fine.

&gt; How did you feel about your work/life balance as a teleworker? How did it compare to more traditional jobs?

Much better work/life balance. I can help my wife out with watching the kids if she has an appointment, for example. I'm done at 5pm and see my kids the entire night whereas commuting left little time in the evenings for this. If I need to work late, the family is very comfortable with it because I'm still around to talk, etc.

An issue with office work for me was mandatory socializing and just the sense that you were visible all the time. At home, you can just focus on the work a lot more and save the socializing for family and friends.

&gt; How did your manager impact your work/life balance?

Current manager is very positive. Like I stated, he leaves me alone for the most part.

&gt; As a remote worker, how isolated did you feel from team members or professional peers?

I'd say I'm more out of the loop in terms of how the company is doing than I am with my peers. We communicate in meetings and chat, so we're not out of touch. I also have met nearly everyone face-to-face and some employees I worked with in-office for a year.

&gt; How did your manager help you feel connected to the organization and its goals?

He really does nothing. I speak to peers for that info. This is true of office work, too, as managers tend to just push the executive spin.

&gt; What guidelines or expectations did your company provide for communicating effectively?

Just that my work get done. That's about it.

&gt; What did you do on a daily or weekly basis to ensure that you were being an effective communicator?

Just stay on top of issues as they arise in our issue-tracking software or on group-chat.

&gt; Were your accomplishments visible to your manager, team, and company?

My manager sees my work and feedback on it, so my work is very visible to the team.

&gt; What training did you receive in order to be an effective remote worker?

Nothing relating to remote work. I work in software and many employees work from home full-time or periodically. It's nothing complicated.

Hope that helps!","1"

I've been in a similar situation (working for a U.S. company but travelling to and from Canada) and there is no issue with that. The problem for you is this:

Unless you have a reason to be in the U.S. (as in a work-related reason for being there, a visit to a friend with a place to stay, etc) you will be required to return to Canada after a short stay. 

If you attempt to cross the border, mention you will be working remotely, and say that you don't have a home in Canada anymore, you will 100% be denied entry.

I applied to live in Canada and was granted citizenship, so now I live here and work for a U.S. company. You may consider applying for a visa, as it's the only way you won't get refused entry to the US or deported later on for lying to the immigration officers.","2"

You definitely need to feel like it wouldnt be an unreasonable request, based on your companys culture, but if it *does* seem feasible, this is the next step: Highlight how you will do your job just as well (or better) from home, not how much more convenient it will be for you. You could also start smallif you dont already, see if you can work from home a few days a week and build that trust. (This is what I did.)

If your company bites, whether temporarily in SoCal or in allowing you to move elsewhere, my advice is to be very clear in your communication and clarify everything in regards to a work from home relationship. Clearly understood expectations in regards to your workload management, how you engage with your manager and coworkers (phone, webex, Skype, etc), how you can be reached, when you can be reached, any expenses that should be covered by your employer (voip/cell phone, computer equipment, internet stipend, Office supplies, etc). 

My experience has been that what is sometimes assumed when you with in the same physical location has to be explicit when remote. Its not a bad thing, but it can be easy to feel annoying when you require clarification more regularly than your non-remote colleagues. ","3"

Had an online  written exam, cleared.

Had a 1.5 hr telephonic  interview with a 3 member panel (sr. developer/arch guy, dba guy, mgr). Cleared.

The technical interview was a little bit more than an hour. I knew most of the stuff. There were some scenario questions so I was thinking out loud with my thought process. Felt I did fine on the tech part. 

Then came the mgr part....The mgr wanted someone who was really interested in programming and development kind of work so he asked lots of questions on what I did in the past, stuff outside work, gave me a sample project to work out and liked it. We hit the same wavelength when he asked about industry level folks I follow and podcasts I listen to....since they were on his list to...I had an online presence which anyone could find out by googling so I'm sure he did that since I got to know his habits and tendencies after I joined.  I felt like I was pretty much just having a conversation with him when he took over since we seemed to be of the same mind when it came to stuff.. 

He said there would be one more round with the director and after we hung up, the recruiter called back within an hour that they didn't want to wait and wanted to proceed. So I accepted the offer. 

He got me to do the tech part for a lot of subsequent interviews. He would reject around 95% of applicants and some  few even if they sounded good technically because they didn't seem to exhume the drive. He said that he wanted self driven, independent,  energy folks as  being remote and not interacting with people would take a toll eventually and he didn't want to micromanage folks.

And if it comes as any consolation, finding remote work is 20x harder than a normal non-remote job. One of the recruiters who interviewed me for a job had said that when they originally posted the position for being located in-office, they had about 25 people apply. But when they made it a remote job, they had over 400 people apply. (Note: I didn't get past that first round interview LOL).

A lot of simple issues can be fixed then. 

My tips would be:
- use your service desk software to assess your support needs. What volume of tickets are you generating and where, who are your repeat offenders, etc. 
- develop a knowledge base. A good one. Empower the users to self-service.
- analyse how your laptop builds are done. How do you deliver software to a user, how do you host data, etc. Can you tailor this to suit remote workers better?","1"

For your situation, consider getting the users used to having to deal with a phone call to desktop support as a first line of contact.  Allow the support person handling the phone to work from home while the second desktop support is in the office.  Alternate, or do week rotations, etc.

This way there's always somebody following up to tickets via phone fairly quickly, doing some basic troubleshooting, and escalating to the on-site staff.  This frees the on-site staff up to do more in-depth work, be away from the desk troubleshooting in-person, etc.

It also allows you to point out where more staff are needed.

As has been pointed out already, you can use screen sharing software to resolve issues.  The company I work for, when I was working in their HQ office, 90% of the time I had issues with my laptop desktop support would fix it over screen sharing, and they were only a few floors down from me.  In case of hardware issues though, like a broken trackpad or screen etc., you would need some way of troubleshooting (shipping the device, having local MSP, etc.).

We have a mess of a shared network drive and Asana is getting bigger than it needs to be so there needs to be a bit of cleaning up and organizing on our side.","1_1"

A bit of a Hawaiian answer to this would be - I know you have money concerns, but there are so many free things you can do here, volunteering or paddling or things that bring you closer to the place, that can help shift that feeling of being adrift a bit. Also, doing those sorts of things brings you into contact with people who might be able to give you insight. Doing these things and meeting these people won't directly change your financial situation, but will probably help you feel more connected, less adrift. 

Some depends on which island, and where; each has a slightly different recipe for this.

* Your hours should overlap at least ~4 hours per day. This makes sure that your team can communicate on a near-realtime basis at some point in the day.
* Your team needs to have a persistent presence during their working hours in a tool like Slack / HipChat / etc. It is extremely helpful to have a mobile client that allows them to be connected when running on an errand.
* You need to press the importance of having your team jump in on the #watercooler channel (or whatever you name it) to have random conversations, post gifs, etc.
* Hook up notifications into the tools your team uses that shows a #firehose channel what they are up to (i.e. github commits, support tickets being handled, etc).
* Have some sort of regular ""touchpoint"" - i.e. a virtual standup in a Slack channel: have them answer this daily: *What did you do yesterday?*, *What are you going to do today?*, and *Is anything blocking you from getting things done?*
* Make sure you use good tools, customize them if needed.
* Make sure the people above you know about the remote team and all the awesome work that they do.
* If at all possible, every 3, 6 or 12 months, get everybody in the same room, somewhere in the world. Use this time for the creative planning and preparing for the next project/quarter/year. Ideas flow much easier when people are in the same room around a white board.  However the implementation of the plan/ideas that came up when people were in-person can be done efficiently remote...","1"

The strategies there could be summed up into 4 areas you need to closely look at. 

**Communication** - having the right tools for communication and collaboration. Basically just compensating for the fact that you don't bump into each other. 

**Productivity** - You must have a good system in place to ensure that everyone is productive. That would involve giving them flexible work hours as well as tracking output, etc. 

**Hiring** - Right pay and doing some tests as well as having a standard on-boarding process for educating new employees are essential things to take note of.

**Culture** - Even if you don't see each other personally, make sure you still cultivate a healthy company culture. Find time to meet in person (if possible), nurture virtual friendships and create a true team feeling.

The two most common ways this is done in the bureaucrasphere are:

Option A: Employee registers as self-employed (if that is legally required) in their home country and invoices the employer. The salary payment is now an international business-to-business transaction, and must follow the rules for those; the employee is self-employed, and becomes solely responsible for all payments (social security, taxes, insurance, etc.) that need to be deducted from the pay. Note that some countries are a bit picky when it comes to self-employment, and you may or may not meet the criteria.

Option B: Employer hires a local payroll company in the employee's country; employee becomes fiscally employed by the payroll company, who invoice the employer for the salary, deduct all payments, and pay the employee a regular salary as if they were employed locally. The employer paying the payroll company is an international B2B transaction, while the payroll company paying the employee is a normal domestic salary payment. The payroll company becomes responsible for all deductions etc., but they will take a cut of the payment for their services.

In theory, it is also possible to hire employees in the country of the employer, but this gets messy and invoncenient quick, so I'd recommend against.

Disclaimer: this is how me (EU-based) and my employer (UK-based) do business; I am no lawyer, so this may or may not be accurate - take it as the layman's understanding that it is.","1"

My company has about 40% of our workforce remote and we have really low turnover. Its clearly not a problem for our company but we have a very strong remote work culture where remote employees are included in just about everything. Our CEO has even done virtual Q&amp;As for full-time remote employees. 

If the stat is true for your company, it might have more to do with your companys remote culture.  People go remote, find communication difficult, start to feel forgotten and left out, and eventually they find another job. 

So on that note, you might propose a time frame (3-6 months or so) where you switch to full-time remote but still live in the area. This will allow to get a feel for your companys remote culture and work out any areas of concern before leaving the state. Personally, I think this would be valuable information for HR as I would see that stat as more of an area concern. If they get remote work figured out and lower the turnover it opens up a number of benefits.

1. Happier employees who want that sort of schedule. 
2. Access to employees in other states at a potentially lower cost. 
3. Access to highly skilled employees in other states who might not want to move.
4. Able to grow and scale easier/lower cost as your company could stay in current building longer even with growth. 
5. Ability to incorporate remote work into a disaster recovery plan, which can help your company recover faster in the event of a disaster. Probably a good plan to have in LA with the risk of earthquakes. 
6. [Millennials are increasingly wanting to work remotely ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/heidilynnekurter/2018/11/15/5-ways-millennials-are-shaking-up-the-workforce-from-the-bottom-up/) Not having this option or a not so great remote culture could limit their ability to attract and retain young talent.

To be perfectly honest, I would say that my employer doesn't truly have a ""remote culture"" yet, as we have only rather recently embraced remote work of any kind a few years ago. Even though part-time remote is very easy to arrange now, many employees here voluntarily choose to come into the office every day simply because they don't feel comfortable with the notion of working from home, and among those who don't I would say a much smaller fraction are full time remote, most of whom probably obtained the privilege as a condition for being hired before we had an official policy in place. So I suspect that because we don't have a remote work culture fully established just yet, many of the would be full time remote employees (who probably need the arrangement for family circumstances) don't like to rely on electronic forms of communication. In fact, when I had this discussion with one of my project managers, he said that although he strongly supports a remote work arrangement in my case, he also pointed out that he personally prefers commuting to the office.","1_1_1_1"

https://www.techrepublic.com/article/4-reasons-why-you-should-hire-remote-workers/

The important caveat is that the average annual raise for employee is about 3% (https://fortune.com/2018/10/11/pay-raise-bonus-2019-increase-salary/) , whereas changing companies gets you about 5% (https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/switch-jobs-earn-more-0517). Overtime that can lead to you becoming underpaid (https://www.forbes.com/sites/cameronkeng/2014/06/22/employees-that-stay-in-companies-longer-than-2-years-get-paid-50-less/).

In reality, it would have to be a 15-20% pay increase to get me to leave my current remote role. The flexibility afforded me is incredible. My current manager is amazing. I live in a great house in an even better town. I am extremely content in my life. Content people just don't go changing things unless there is a huge upside.","2"

Doesn't matter how good a worker you personally are.  It just takes one other person to abuse the system and now they are scared about it for everyone (I have seen this happen more than once at more than one company).  They just won't outright say these things to you and come up with other ""reasons"".   Do they have the data / research to back up the first claim of out of state workers leaving?

1) Not being physically in L.A. most of the time, you couldn't easily find another job which allowed you to work remotely in the specific place you like, so it'd be very difficult to switch to another L.A. company; and

2) There are no jobs in the physical location which have the appeal and advantages of working for an L.A. company in your industry, so it'd also be very difficult to switch to a Colorado company.

Also traveling back and forth between California and Colorado would be expensive when they don't have to pay that cost currently. Take a moment and put yourself in the manager's shoes and the HR people's shoes.

If it's slow, I still eat at lunch at my desk, but then take a 30 minute break to go do chores around the house.

As for the social interaction aspect, I am an extrovert, and what I found is I am engaged with my local community instead of my work community. Church, toastmasters, dads club, book club, etc. plus, since I do pick up and drop off of my kids, there are also lots of parents to have those daily casual conversations you would have at the copier or water cooler.

I am also not shy about beginning and ending every conversation over skype / phone with 5 minutes of chit chat.

Almost all of those social connections I had built evaporated as soon as I went out of the parking lot. People I worked closely with for years didnt even bother inviting me their wedding. And I was heartbroken to be honest.

I realized that most work friendships are built on the convenience of being in he building and seeing each other at the cafe or conference rooms. Its kind of like being a townie. If you stay in the town everyone knows you. If you move away, they forget you exist.

So rather than waste my time building friendships at work I built them in my community through groups I want to be involved with. Sure they can be just as fickle, but at least I dont have to depend on my lively hood to get my social interaction on.","6_1_1"

Site rating and social media evaluating positions are part-time, but the former allows more hours and pays more than the latter. There is no formal interview process. The only thing that might be difficult is the test potential site raters need to take in order to secure the position. Many people dont pass it but there are resources out there to help.

The last job I had was 100% remote, and the client often made after-hours requests.  For about a year, I'd just hop back on and start working again... and eventually, I realized that this was symptomatic of their management consistently fucking up the workflow.  I started holding them to ""I work these hours, and if there's not enough work to do during those hours, then whatever work appears will get done the next time there's a workday morning - not at 11pm the night before, and not over a weekend unless you cleared it ahead of time.""

When I started making those shifts, I was worried that I'd get in trouble.  I didn't.  The client started to get their shit together - they started fixing their workflow.  I ended up leaving for other reasons, but that job taught me a *lot* about being willing to stick up for myself.","2"

It should be fairly obvious that the answer is ""don't""; if you think about it with half a brain for like 30 seconds, you should come to the same conclusion.

So here are your legal and uncontroversial options.

1. Contact whoever is in charge at your company and present your case; ask under which conditions an exception could possibly be made. I wouldn't get my hopes up here, though; it sounds like your company is the kind that prefers covering their legal asses at all cost.
2. Don't go. You have probably signed an agreement that says something along the lines of ""work remotely from anywhere within the U.S.""; so do what you agreed to.
3. Quit. If your employer doesn't cooperate, and the employment agreement allows them that stance, then this is the only way to get out of it. There are employers who won't mind, so if this is super important to you, find one, and get them to hire you.","1"

I have a laptop that is not the one I do work on. Its only used for connecting to a US vpn server I setup myself (not talking about my work vpn server). In osx, you can configure internet connection sharing in a way that the source adapter is your vpn connection (rather than a physical adapter such as wifi or ethernet cards). So when i connect to my US vpn and then connection is made, osx begins internet sharing using the vpn as a source. My work computer will get an internal IP given to it by my first laptop. The public IP will seem to be the VPN server IP. Unless you do a traceroute, its hard for that computer to know its behind a vpn. It thinks it just got an IP address thru dhcp from a normal router rather than from a laptop using ics to share a vpn connection. At this point, Im free to use my work computer to connect to my work vpn. The work vpn will see this connection being made from the VPN service public IP. (This also why I setup my own vpn server. Just in case my work notices I am using an IP from a popular vpn service. Im probably just paranoid tho). 

One thing to note about the internet sharing laptop and connections. Assume my hotel internet is through wifi. I would join the internet with my wifi adapter and then configure internet connection sharing to use the VPN connection (which will connect thru the wifi) as a source and the ethernet adapter as destination. 

If my hotel wifi goes down, it causes my vpn to disconnect, which causes the internet connection sharing to stop within osx. Therefore my work computer just gets disconnected completely from the internet. My foreign IP is never revealed to my work VPN server or work computer. I make sure to never connect my work computer to the hotel wifi so it will not attempt to get back online through a foreign IP. It only is able to get online through an active shared connection from the laptop. ","3_1_1"

Ive also used privateinternetaccess.com and theyre pretty generous with how much speed they give you as well.

Another time, I worked for a company that used gmail business. Like an idiot, for some reason I logged in using a non vpnd computer. Totally my fault. They called me on it, I made some excuse about using tor haha, and they didnt bring it up again. This sorta has nothing to do with the vpn setup weve been discussing, but still worth noting perhaps. 

If that first issue I described was due to the routing tables, the reason I might not have seen this problem again could be because I am much more paranoid about my work laptop for certain companies.

The only problem there is that such a setup would be extremely fragile - a loss of power sufficient to drain the battery, or accidentally closing Teamviewer remotely on the laptop, and you'd need someone physically at the laptop to re-run Teamviewer for you. If you can't arrange this, you could be stuck on the other side of the world while your laptop idles and your company wonders why you're not doing any work.

Not to mention it's also possible that the laptop logs any application launched on it, meaning that evidence of what you did will be stored on it (and possibly sent to company records).

Another possibility, if you can activate any built-in remote connection software on your laptop such as Windows Remote Desktop, is to allow connections to it from a local network, then have another computer sitting on that network which can be remotely connected to from outside the network. You connect to the second computer from wherever, then run a remote session across the local network to the laptop.

As an alternative, I'd suggest paying them according to their result; their output.   


That said however, a weekly salary based on results requires weekly goals that follow the SMART rule of thumb. So, the manager has a lot more work to do in this case. The weekly goal has to be broken down into smaller and achievable steps to the point where any good-enough employee could attain. Then it's a matter of skill and work ethos in my opinion. Exceptional, hard working employees, who like your company will, probably, attain their weekly quotas earlier than the deadline and request for more; obviously, they should be payed more.   
On the other hand, those who'd struggle may struggle due to various reasons and not just because of their skill level or their integrity. You then have to work with them and figure out why they don't meet the targets. Is it because the bar has been set to high? Are they slow learners? Is it because they cannot manage their time efficiently? Would they need often 1on1 calls? and so on and so forth. Evidently, in this case, the manager would again have to put in more work and effort on investigating the reasons.  


Bottom line, I find the value based on working hours a bit lazy and not entirely objective. That being said, for me you should discuss it with them and then experiment. Distributed teams require clear-cut, honest and transparent comms in order to be effective, so take their opinion on the matter.

There really is no useful information in that hourly log other than time tracking for pay slip purposes which is important...si maybe it needs to be presented differently as an HR process.

2. will become a formality/chore

3. reminds everyone that you don't trust them

Again, I think it needs to be presented as an HR process and not a micromanaging effort. Things like paid leave, sick leave , public holidays etc are important aspects of a job

Things to consider to make the team more cohesive and driven: 

1. Hiring process should be revealing and help to filter ideal candidates for remote positions. People with drive, interest in the line of work, independent, can communicate. You need to warn up about lack office social culture, deduce that they don't have time consuming  side jobs or projects that take up your time (this was something  my former boss did not like and learned the hard way. He was very picky when it came to remote.positions)

2. Judge by work done and completion time. You or someone overseeing g them should be technically sound so they don't BS their way around.

3. Daily stand up calls

4. IM, emails, recorded meetings  &amp; presentations to make up for  collaboration that is otherwise difficult with remote positions.

5. Develop lean documentation and processes for requirements gathering and other phases of software life cycle.         ","13"

Expect yourself to be more productive.  Being in the office means you're talking with others, taking breaks, going out to lunch, whatever.  This can certainly be good for networking, but on the flip side it hurts productivity.  A recent study (https://ideas.ted.com/why-working-from-home-should-be-standard-practice/) found a 13% increase in productivity.  This may mean that you will be able to work fewer hours without sacrificing your work quality.

I transitioned to wfh full time a little over a year ago, though stayed in the same location. Im sort of a pilot for the wfh setup on my team, so Im the only one. 

A defined office space was a must for me, though I have two little ones so that was a main driver initially. I bought a variable height desk as well, so I can sit or stand, and went the extra mile to make the space nice and defined, since I spend a lot of time there. It also helped me to psychologically set boundaries between work and Home life. I found this to be the most difficult adjustment to wfh full time, as I started to see work stress bleed into focus on Home life and vice Versa.

In terms of communication, I realized that I was getting left out or not getting the full experience of the communication going on, so I went the route to set an example of how Id like to be communicated with. Started using video even if I was the only one, detailed agendas, emails, etc. its caught on and the rest of my team seems to benefit from it was well now. 

Most of my work is independent, and I find I am more productive than when I was in an office, which is nice. I think I would have a hard time going back to an office now that I've tasted the flexibility. 

Hope this helps, best of luck. 

Edit: added one word

And socially, I try to get it if the house for a lunch with friends or an errand one or two times a week. On slow or documentation days I sometimes go work out of a coffee shop. I recommend getting creative with the flexibility, and find reasons to see people :)","3"

2. Understand that productivity is increased when working from home, so, don't feel guilty if you are done early.
3. Try to set up in\-person meetings with clients and team mates that are spread out through the year. Arrange for these meetings at the office to coincide with office parties, important town halls, etc. Try to set up calls intermittently with colleagues where conversations are not strictly work related.
4. Have frequent conversations with friends and family specifically on what telecommuting has meant for your relationship. For instance, a friend's wife insisted that he quit his telecommuting job because his mind was never away from work

- the time zone difference is difficult. Be prepared to eat at odd times and make sure you're planning ahead so that you have food and water readily available.

- if you're working from home, and there aren't cameras required for video conferencing, dress as comfortably as you can. I'm only NOT in pajama pants if I need to run an errand that day.

- definitely establish a ""work sanctuary"" and make sure the household knows the rules for entering. Things like: if the door is shut, don't enter, etc. Get an interior bedroom lock for the door for those times you REALLY can't be interrupted.

- you will be more productive. You will also find it easier to be more distracted. Most of us do that at work anyway, so embrace it. Allow yourself the mental break and diversion from time to time. Schedule it even if you can. By accepting it and anticipating it, it's less likely to be an issue.

- establish boundaries that clearly identify when you're off work. Don't let work abuse your time by assuming you're always available at their whim. YMMV depending on job responsibilities, but it's easy for other to just assume you're the most available person to go to since your office connection is right there.

- reliable internet, obviously. Dual Wan/ISPs load balanced is an effective and rather inexpensive solution to ensure maximum uptime (if the option is available).

- do whatever you can to give the impression to anyone you interact with that you're just another employee in the office. Don't give anyone an opportunity to scapegoat your situation, especially those who might be jealous and try to undermine you. 

- enjoy it. Full time WFH is a rare opportunity.

I personally am a bit casual with the billing.  I think an extra 5 minutes could easily get rounded up into a full half hour. If I'm reading your question correctly, you're wondering whether it's justified to round up by 5 minutes 4 or 5 times (thus padding an extra 30minutes total). I think this is still within reason because as you said, that extra 5 minute break is helping keep you functional and focused on the project throughout the day. 

Other professionals do this as well. Lawyers or consultants would charge time in 15m or 30m or even 1h intervals.  Obviously you can give them a break and not charge them for a 5min phone conversation if you didn't do any additional work all day. But if you do 25m of work, then most people would see that as being ok to bill a full 30m, even if you took a break repeatedly.

I would only list specific features and how long you worked on them overall. (Ex: Modified shopping cart to calc tax. 2h 30m.  Added detail page to product list. 3h)  Even if it's a bit of hand waving and in reality it took you 3 hours to do something that you claimed took 2h 30m because either your friend called you up on the phone, or you switched to another task temporarily and then came back again.

If the work needs real-time responses, such as answering calls, attending remote meetings, or always being available during certain times, that's going to affect how you can schedule breaks. If it's looser (say, for example, mainly microproject work and you check in by email a few times a week), you'll have more freedom.

As for personal preferences, everyone's different. Some people work best with a very rigid schedule keeping them ticking along. Others like to dive in, work their ass off on a chunk of inbox fodder, and take breaks during natural divisions in the workload (which may be at different times on different days). Some even take no breaks on certain days, and longer breaks on others.

You're in the same situation as I was in 4 years ago.  I graduated with my M.S. In Computer Science in the Spring of 2010 with one goal. I wanted to snowboard and travel as much as possible. I had a one way ticket to New Zealand, a working holiday visa, and a little bit of money. The prospect of struggling financially while finally doing something I was truly passionate about was a no brainer decision after spending so many years doing what I was supposed to be doing.

I struggled for the first two years. I worked shitty jobs while I did contract web development on the side, but I loved every minute of it. I was snowboarding 200+ days a year. Along the way I built up a portfolio, learned a lot of lessons, and now I make a really comfortable living working exclusively remotely. In the last 12 months alone, I've spent time in Australia, New Zealand, Austria, Indonesia, China, Philippines, Japan, Korea, Italy, and I've been in Switzerland for the last 6 weeks.

I have to disagree with TopRamen, it is the exact same advice I received when I made the decision to not look for a real job. There are several issues with the idea that you can spend a few years getting experience working in an office. The biggest is that you are going to get comfortable with the security. When you finally dive into freelance full time, it is terrifying. But, going from a poor college student to a poor freelancer is a much easier transition then giving up a 6 figure salary to make websites. I agree that you will get valuable experience, but you can still work with other skilled devs while freelancing.

My advice to you is to just make the leap. If you really want this life, don't be afraid to fail. There is so much work out there for competent web developers.

Just keep searching job boards and apply like crazy.

Also don't rely on the job boards telecommute flag, I've seen lots of jobs that are telecommute but you have to just search the word 'Remote' or 'telecommute' to find them.

I was one of the best coders in my class, but straight out of school, I was nowhere near ready to work on my own.

Going into work, having real mentors around 40 hours/week, learning standard industry practices, meetings, code reviews etc... I learned more about practical programming in my first couple months on site than I did in the average year of college. Not to mention acquiring the discipline that I needed to counter my natural tendency to procrastinate.

That said, find something you like and get really good at it. I do ruby, and there's a good amount of telecommuting opportunities doing it. I'm not sure about machine learning/distributed computing, that's pretty far from my experience.

Work on building your career, and as you get good, the opportunities will pop up. I worked in the office or on site for 3 years, then remotely a few days/week for 2 years, then got 3 offers for mostly/all remote jobs within 2 weeks of each other.

Weekly or twice weekly Teams meetings with your small work unit to check in with each other
Set up 1:1 time with a coworker to get to know them in a personal level, if you wish (coffee chat invite via outlook, just 15-30 min)
Have a monthly photo recap- someone on the team is sent a PowerPoint slide from each person of pictures from their life events the month prior that they can put into a presentation and email out to the group. Can also include book and recipe and TV series recs
Less personal, more work-related, but you could ask for a workplace mentor who you meet with monthly just to check in on any questions re:work policies, benefits, culture, advancement, career goals etc.","1"

* Your hours should overlap at least ~4 hours per day. This makes sure that your team can communicate on a near-realtime basis at some point in the day.
* Your team needs to have a persistent presence during their working hours in a tool like Slack / HipChat / etc. It is extremely helpful to have a mobile client that allows them to be connected when running on an errand.
* You need to press the importance of having your team jump in on the #watercooler channel (or whatever you name it) to have random conversations, post gifs, etc.
* Hook up notifications into the tools your team uses that shows a #firehose channel what they are up to (i.e. github commits, support tickets being handled, etc).
* Have some sort of regular ""touchpoint"" - i.e. a virtual standup in a Slack channel: have them answer this daily: *What did you do yesterday?*, *What are you going to do today?*, and *Is anything blocking you from getting things done?*
* Make sure you use good tools, customize them if needed.
* Make sure the people above you know about the remote team and all the awesome work that they do.
* If at all possible, every 3, 6 or 12 months, get everybody in the same room, somewhere in the world. Use this time for the creative planning and preparing for the next project/quarter/year. Ideas flow much easier when people are in the same room around a white board.  However the implementation of the plan/ideas that came up when people were in-person can be done efficiently remote...","1"

The strategies there could be summed up into 4 areas you need to closely look at. 

**Communication** - having the right tools for communication and collaboration. Basically just compensating for the fact that you don't bump into each other. 

**Productivity** - You must have a good system in place to ensure that everyone is productive. That would involve giving them flexible work hours as well as tracking output, etc. 

**Hiring** - Right pay and doing some tests as well as having a standard on-boarding process for educating new employees are essential things to take note of.

**Culture** - Even if you don't see each other personally, make sure you still cultivate a healthy company culture. Find time to meet in person (if possible), nurture virtual friendships and create a true team feeling. 

Good luck in hiring and building that team!","2"

The two most common ways this is done in the bureaucrasphere are:

Option A: Employee registers as self-employed (if that is legally required) in their home country and invoices the employer. The salary payment is now an international business-to-business transaction, and must follow the rules for those; the employee is self-employed, and becomes solely responsible for all payments (social security, taxes, insurance, etc.) that need to be deducted from the pay. Note that some countries are a bit picky when it comes to self-employment, and you may or may not meet the criteria.

Option B: Employer hires a local payroll company in the employee's country; employee becomes fiscally employed by the payroll company, who invoice the employer for the salary, deduct all payments, and pay the employee a regular salary as if they were employed locally. The employer paying the payroll company is an international B2B transaction, while the payroll company paying the employee is a normal domestic salary payment. The payroll company becomes responsible for all deductions etc., but they will take a cut of the payment for their services.

In theory, it is also possible to hire employees in the country of the employer, but this gets messy and invoncenient quick, so I'd recommend against.

Disclaimer: this is how me (EU-based) and my employer (UK-based) do business; I am no lawyer, so this may or may not be accurate - take it as the layman's understanding that it is.","1"

My company has about 40% of our workforce remote and we have really low turnover. Its clearly not a problem for our company but we have a very strong remote work culture where remote employees are included in just about everything. Our CEO has even done virtual Q&amp;As for full-time remote employees. 

If the stat is true for your company, it might have more to do with your companys remote culture.  People go remote, find communication difficult, start to feel forgotten and left out, and eventually they find another job. 

So on that note, you might propose a time frame (3-6 months or so) where you switch to full-time remote but still live in the area. This will allow to get a feel for your companys remote culture and work out any areas of concern before leaving the state. Personally, I think this would be valuable information for HR as I would see that stat as more of an area concern. If they get remote work figured out and lower the turnover it opens up a number of benefits.

1. Happier employees who want that sort of schedule. 
2. Access to employees in other states at a potentially lower cost. 
3. Access to highly skilled employees in other states who might not want to move.
4. Able to grow and scale easier/lower cost as your company could stay in current building longer even with growth. 
5. Ability to incorporate remote work into a disaster recovery plan, which can help your company recover faster in the event of a disaster. Probably a good plan to have in LA with the risk of earthquakes. 
6. [Millennials are increasingly wanting to work remotely ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/heidilynnekurter/2018/11/15/5-ways-millennials-are-shaking-up-the-workforce-from-the-bottom-up/) Not having this option or a not so great remote culture could limit their ability to attract and retain young talent.

To be perfectly honest, I would say that my employer doesn't truly have a ""remote culture"" yet, as we have only rather recently embraced remote work of any kind a few years ago. Even though part-time remote is very easy to arrange now, many employees here voluntarily choose to come into the office every day simply because they don't feel comfortable with the notion of working from home, and among those who don't I would say a much smaller fraction are full time remote, most of whom probably obtained the privilege as a condition for being hired before we had an official policy in place. So I suspect that because we don't have a remote work culture fully established just yet, many of the would be full time remote employees (who probably need the arrangement for family circumstances) don't like to rely on electronic forms of communication. In fact, when I had this discussion with one of my project managers, he said that although he strongly supports a remote work arrangement in my case, he also pointed out that he personally prefers commuting to the office.","1_1_1_1"

https://www.techrepublic.com/article/4-reasons-why-you-should-hire-remote-workers/

The important caveat is that the average annual raise for employee is about 3% (https://fortune.com/2018/10/11/pay-raise-bonus-2019-increase-salary/) , whereas changing companies gets you about 5% (https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/switch-jobs-earn-more-0517).

In reality, it would have to be a 15-20% pay increase to get me to leave my current remote role. The flexibility afforded me is incredible. My current manager is amazing.

1) Not being physically in L.A. most of the time, you couldn't easily find another job which allowed you to work remotely in the specific place you like, so it'd be very difficult to switch to another L.A. company; and

2) There are no jobs in the physical location which have the appeal and advantages of working for an L.A. company in your industry, so it'd also be very difficult to switch to a Colorado company.

Note that this lock-in *only* happens with the telecommuting combination.","4"

However, if you have an extrovert, it can be a great way to communicate and help them enjoy their telecommute position more.

The last job I had was 100% remote, and the client often made after-hours requests.  For about a year, I'd just hop back on and start working again... and eventually, I realized that this was symptomatic of their management consistently fucking up the workflow.  I started holding them to ""I work these hours, and if there's not enough work to do during those hours, then whatever work appears will get done the next time there's a workday morning - not at 11pm the night before, and not over a weekend unless you cleared it ahead of time.""

When I started making those shifts, I was worried that I'd get in trouble.  I didn't.  The client started to get their shit together - they started fixing their workflow.  I ended up leaving for other reasons, but that job taught me a *lot* about being willing to stick up for myself.","2"

It should be fairly obvious that the answer is ""don't""; if you think about it with half a brain for like 30 seconds, you should come to the same conclusion.

So here are your legal and uncontroversial options.

1. Contact whoever is in charge at your company and present your case; ask under which conditions an exception could possibly be made. I wouldn't get my hopes up here, though; it sounds like your company is the kind that prefers covering their legal asses at all cost.
2. Don't go. You have probably signed an agreement that says something along the lines of ""work remotely from anywhere within the U.S.""; so do what you agreed to.
3. Quit. If your employer doesn't cooperate, and the employment agreement allows them that stance, then this is the only way to get out of it. There are employers who won't mind, so if this is super important to you, find one, and get them to hire you.","1"

I have a laptop that is not the one I do work on. Its only used for connecting to a US vpn server I setup myself (not talking about my work vpn server). In osx, you can configure internet connection sharing in a way that the source adapter is your vpn connection (rather than a physical adapter such as wifi or ethernet cards). So when i connect to my US vpn and then connection is made, osx begins internet sharing using the vpn as a source. My work computer will get an internal IP given to it by my first laptop. The public IP will seem to be the VPN server IP. Unless you do a traceroute, its hard for that computer to know its behind a vpn. It thinks it just got an IP address thru dhcp from a normal router rather than from a laptop using ics to share a vpn connection. At this point, Im free to use my work computer to connect to my work vpn. The work vpn will see this connection being made from the VPN service public IP. (This also why I setup my own vpn server. Just in case my work notices I am using an IP from a popular vpn service. Im probably just paranoid tho). 

One thing to note about the internet sharing laptop and connections. Assume my hotel internet is through wifi. I would join the internet with my wifi adapter and then configure internet connection sharing to use the VPN connection (which will connect thru the wifi) as a source and the ethernet adapter as destination. 

If my hotel wifi goes down, it causes my vpn to disconnect, which causes the internet connection sharing to stop within osx. Therefore my work computer just gets disconnected completely from the internet. My foreign IP is never revealed to my work VPN server or work computer. I make sure to never connect my work computer to the hotel wifi so it will not attempt to get back online through a foreign IP. It only is able to get online through an active shared connection from the laptop. ","3_1_1"

If anything the slowdown will probably be due to the vpn provider or hardware on the vpn server. Maybe in terms of it throttling the connection or speed of encrypting packets.  I use my own colo and servers so I dont see hardly any speedtest performance loss except for ping obviously. Ive also used privateinternetaccess.com and theyre pretty generous with how much speed they give you as well. 

In like 5 years of doing this, I have actually got into trouble once. I was screensharing with a coworker and i googled something in front of him. Blatant non english google ads from the country i was in showed up haha. Luckily my coworker just had a laugh and never mentioned it again. He honestly didnt care. Only thing I can think of was a glitch in the routing tables or dns cache from the computer I was using?? Honestly not quite sure. It only occurred that one single time too! Horrible luck haha. 

Another time, I worked for a company that used gmail business. Like an idiot, for some reason I logged in using a non vpnd computer. Totally my fault. They called me on it, I made some excuse about using tor haha, and they didnt bring it up again. This sorta has nothing to do with the vpn setup weve been discussing, but still worth noting perhaps. 

If that first issue I described was due to the routing tables, the reason I might not have seen this problem again could be because I am much more paranoid about my work laptop for certain companies. I only ever connect it to wifi that is vpnd into the US. I never connect it to a local wifi abroad. ","3_1_1_1_1"

The only problem there is that such a setup would be extremely fragile - a loss of power sufficient to drain the battery, or accidentally closing Teamviewer remotely on the laptop, and you'd need someone physically at the laptop to re-run Teamviewer for you. If you can't arrange this, you could be stuck on the other side of the world while your laptop idles and your company wonders why you're not doing any work.

Not to mention it's also possible that the laptop logs any application launched on it, meaning that evidence of what you did will be stored on it (and possibly sent to company records).

Another possibility, if you can activate any built-in remote connection software on your laptop such as Windows Remote Desktop, is to allow connections to it from a local network, then have another computer sitting on that network which can be remotely connected to from outside the network. You connect to the second computer from wherever, then run a remote session across the local network to the laptop.

there should be a way -- slack, group email, etc. -- for workers to express that they're blocked or need help.  if your team requires a daily standup to discuss blocking issues then i think there is a larger problem at hand.

in my experience, the standup is to allow a distributed team to discuss and understand what each member is up to and communicates how the team is operating as a whole.  i've worked for years like this and it works well.  we'd do standups twice a week and it was a good balance.","2_1_3_2_2"

As an alternative, I'd suggest paying them according to their result; their output.   


That said however, a weekly salary based on results requires weekly goals that follow the SMART rule of thumb. So, the manager has a lot more work to do in this case. The weekly goal has to be broken down into smaller and achievable steps to the point where any good-enough employee could attain. Then it's a matter of skill and work ethos in my opinion. Exceptional, hard working employees, who like your company will, probably, attain their weekly quotas earlier than the deadline and request for more; obviously, they should be payed more.   
On the other hand, those who'd struggle may struggle due to various reasons and not just because of their skill level or their integrity. You then have to work with them and figure out why they don't meet the targets. Is it because the bar has been set to high? Are they slow learners? Is it because they cannot manage their time efficiently? Would they need often 1on1 calls? and so on and so forth. Evidently, in this case, the manager would again have to put in more work and effort on investigating the reasons.  


Bottom line, I find the value based on working hours a bit lazy and not entirely objective. That being said, for me you should discuss it with them and then experiment. Distributed teams require clear-cut, honest and transparent comms in order to be effective, so take their opinion on the matter.   


My 2 cents.","7"

Again, I think it needs to be presented as an HR process and not a micromanaging effort. Things like paid leave, sick leave , public holidays etc are important aspects of a job

Things to consider to make the team more cohesive and driven: 

1. Hiring process should be revealing and help to filter ideal candidates for remote positions. People with drive, interest in the line of work, independent, can communicate. You need to warn up about lack office social culture, deduce that they don't have time consuming  side jobs or projects that take up your time (this was something  my former boss did not like and learned the hard way. He was very picky when it came to remote.positions)

2. Judge by work done and completion time. You or someone overseeing g them should be technically sound so they don't BS their way around.

3. Daily stand up calls

4. IM, emails, recorded meetings  &amp; presentations to make up for  collaboration that is otherwise difficult with remote positions.

5. Develop lean documentation and processes for requirements gathering and other phases of software life cycle.         ","13"

Expect yourself to be more productive.  Being in the office means you're talking with others, taking breaks, going out to lunch, whatever.

I transitioned to wfh full time a little over a year ago, though stayed in the same location. Im sort of a pilot for the wfh setup on my team, so Im the only one. 

A defined office space was a must for me, though I have two little ones so that was a main driver initially. I bought a variable height desk as well, so I can sit or stand, and went the extra mile to make the space nice and defined, since I spend a lot of time there. It also helped me to psychologically set boundaries between work and Home life. I found this to be the most difficult adjustment to wfh full time, as I started to see work stress bleed into focus on Home life and vice Versa.

In terms of communication, I realized that I was getting left out or not getting the full experience of the communication going on, so I went the route to set an example of how Id like to be communicated with. Started using video even if I was the only one, detailed agendas, emails, etc. its caught on and the rest of my team seems to benefit from it was well now. 

Most of my work is independent, and I find I am more productive than when I was in an office, which is nice. I think I would have a hard time going back to an office now that I've tasted the flexibility. 

Hope this helps, best of luck. 

Edit: added one word

- the time zone difference is difficult. Be prepared to eat at odd times and make sure you're planning ahead so that you have food and water readily available.

- if you're working from home, and there aren't cameras required for video conferencing, dress as comfortably as you can. I'm only NOT in pajama pants if I need to run an errand that day.

- definitely establish a ""work sanctuary"" and make sure the household knows the rules for entering. Things like: if the door is shut, don't enter, etc. Get an interior bedroom lock for the door for those times you REALLY can't be interrupted.

- you will be more productive. You will also find it easier to be more distracted. Most of us do that at work anyway, so embrace it. Allow yourself the mental break and diversion from time to time. Schedule it even if you can. By accepting it and anticipating it, it's less likely to be an issue.

- establish boundaries that clearly identify when you're off work. Don't let work abuse your time by assuming you're always available at their whim. YMMV depending on job responsibilities, but it's easy for other to just assume you're the most available person to go to since your office connection is right there.

- reliable internet, obviously. Dual Wan/ISPs load balanced is an effective and rather inexpensive solution to ensure maximum uptime (if the option is available).

- do whatever you can to give the impression to anyone you interact with that you're just another employee in the office. Don't give anyone an opportunity to scapegoat your situation, especially those who might be jealous and try to undermine you. 

- enjoy it. Full time WFH is a rare opportunity.

I personally am a bit casual with the billing.  I think an extra 5 minutes could easily get rounded up into a full half hour. If I'm reading your question correctly, you're wondering whether it's justified to round up by 5 minutes 4 or 5 times (thus padding an extra 30minutes total). I think this is still within reason because as you said, that extra 5 minute break is helping keep you functional and focused on the project throughout the day. 

Other professionals do this as well. Lawyers or consultants would charge time in 15m or 30m or even 1h intervals.  Obviously you can give them a break and not charge them for a 5min phone conversation if you didn't do any additional work all day. But if you do 25m of work, then most people would see that as being ok to bill a full 30m, even if you took a break repeatedly.

I would only list specific features and how long you worked on them overall. (Ex: Modified shopping cart to calc tax. 2h 30m.  Added detail page to product list. 3h)  Even if it's a bit of hand waving and in reality it took you 3 hours to do something that you claimed took 2h 30m because either your friend called you up on the phone, or you switched to another task temporarily and then came back again.

But you aren't constantly working for 7.5 hours (far from it in my experience). You go to the loo for 5 minutes, have a chat about what you did at the weekend for 10 minutes, or a 20 minute trip to Starbucks.

Since I've been working remotely I think I've actually been working a lot harder, as it's not as easy to waste time like that.","1_1"

If the work needs real-time responses, such as answering calls, attending remote meetings, or always being available during certain times, that's going to affect how you can schedule breaks. If it's looser (say, for example, mainly microproject work and you check in by email a few times a week), you'll have more freedom.

As for personal preferences, everyone's different. Some people work best with a very rigid schedule keeping them ticking along. Others like to dive in, work their ass off on a chunk of inbox fodder, and take breaks during natural divisions in the workload (which may be at different times on different days). Some even take no breaks on certain days, and longer breaks on others. Or they go completely freeform and might do half the work at 5am, drop the kids off at school, catch a movie, and do the other half of the work before dinner.","2"

You're in the same situation as I was in 4 years ago.  I graduated with my M.S. In Computer Science in the Spring of 2010 with one goal. I wanted to snowboard and travel as much as possible. I had a one way ticket to New Zealand, a working holiday visa, and a little bit of money. The prospect of struggling financially while finally doing something I was truly passionate about was a no brainer decision after spending so many years doing what I was supposed to be doing.

I struggled for the first two years. I worked shitty jobs while I did contract web development on the side, but I loved every minute of it. I was snowboarding 200+ days a year. Along the way I built up a portfolio, learned a lot of lessons, and now I make a really comfortable living working exclusively remotely. In the last 12 months alone, I've spent time in Australia, New Zealand, Austria, Indonesia, China, Philippines, Japan, Korea, Italy, and I've been in Switzerland for the last 6 weeks.

I have to disagree with TopRamen, it is the exact same advice I received when I made the decision to not look for a real job. There are several issues with the idea that you can spend a few years getting experience working in an office. The biggest is that you are going to get comfortable with the security. When you finally dive into freelance full time, it is terrifying. But, going from a poor college student to a poor freelancer is a much easier transition then giving up a 6 figure salary to make websites. I agree that you will get valuable experience, but you can still work with other skilled devs while freelancing.

My advice to you is to just make the leap. If you really want this life, don't be afraid to fail. There is so much work out there for competent web developers.

Definitely send me a PM if you have any specific questions I can help you out with.","1"

Going into work, having real mentors around 40 hours/week, learning standard industry practices, meetings, code reviews etc... I learned more about practical programming in my first couple months on site than I did in the average year of college. Not to mention acquiring the discipline that I needed to counter my natural tendency to procrastinate.

That said, find something you like and get really good at it. I do ruby, and there's a good amount of telecommuting opportunities doing it. I'm not sure about machine learning/distributed computing, that's pretty far from my experience.

Work on building your career, and as you get good, the opportunities will pop up.

Let's see. Suppose I buy a $5,000 car that'll last me 5 years, that's half the $2000/yr gone already; we're down to $3.63. Gas for a fairly economic car, at European prices, is about $2.70 per day (assuming 1.5 hours averaging 30 mph), or just under $500 per year, further cutting our earnings in half. We're now at $1.81/hr. Now I'm a responsible person, and where I live it's mandatory anyway, so I'll also need insurance, which we shall say costs $20/mo, that's $250/yr. My hourly rate for that commute now shrinks to $0.91. Oh, and I'll also be paying taxes for that car, let's say another $20/mo. Oops, my hourly rate is now $0.00. Oh dear. Now if I start buying coffee on the road, take detours, or buy expensive lunches at the cafeteria rather than eating cheap stuff at home and brewing my own coffee, **I'd actually be paying for the privilege of commuting**.

Which of course isn't entirely fair, because telecommuting means I have to pay for my own coffee (but the bright side is that I get to drink good coffee instead of the suspicious concoction my cheap-ass boss supplies), I'm paying for an internet connection, and if I wanted dedicated office space (which I don't), I'd have to pay for that too. That stuff can easily amount to maybe $500/mo, so that brings us back to $4.08/hr if I haven't made any mistakes. Not exactly tree fiddy, but close, and this is all a back-of-the-envelope thing anyway.","4_1_1"

&gt; Starting in 2019, Vermont will pay people who move there and work remotely for an out-of-state employer $10,000 over two years to cover relocation expenses, coworking memberships, computers, internet, and other work-related expenses.

&gt; In addition to the remote worker plan, Vermont has also launched a program called &amp;quot;Stay to Stay Weekends&amp;quot; aimed at convincing the state&amp;#039;s 13 million annual tourists to relocate there.

&gt; Vermont has budgeted grants for about 100 new remote workers in the first three years of the program and about 20 additional workers per year for every year after.

Setting up emails on a schedule and photoshopping images are both simple tasks that can be done with a few minutes of Googling how-tos.

I don't know that you should feel enraged, however. You're getting a pretty big perk from an organization that doesn't know how to handle it. This is a negative that comes with the positive.

Personally, I would tell your boss that these two ideas would needlessly consume time you could be working on important issues and they would also be relatively simple for you to fake. I would propose a 2-4 week/project trial period (depending on the exact nature of your work and how you can define productivity in it). Ask your boss to continue to measure your productivity level as normal as if you were in the office. If there has been any noticeable change then perhaps you can get into the email/screenshot nonsense.

Your manager and team clearly have no idea what to do this ""WFH"" thing. Some people get it more than others. It also seems like you probably haven't been doing much remote work either.

So per some of the other more constructive comments... ask your manager to work with you on reporting your actual useful work in an intelligent fashion. It's hard to say what that is and how it looks, since it is highly job/business dependent. Surely your manager had a way of determining if you were useful before, more than just walking by and seeing if you were at your desk (and not on reddit). Surely there is a way to translate this to remote. Maybe for a few weeks you need to send your manager daily update emails, and weekly summaries. The trick is both of you need to get comfortable with this and trust the setup. Since you're getting a huge benefit here (I presume you see it is a benefit), be willing go the extra mile to help them feel good about the situation too... within reason.","4"

Sounds like there is a lot of old guard in your workplace that are afraid of change or making things more efficient.

I found for a majority of employees that were resistive to the idea, especially mgmt, that once I showed them some interesting studies, facts and cool things about telecommuting they changed their tune... fast.

Sometimes lack of information and stereotypes are hard to break, which in that case just prove metrics of before and after showing there was no hit to your performance. In my case, I went up due to less distractions in the office and I could take a break whenever I wanted which helped with critical thinking.

List out your accomplishments for yourself. Make clear cut cases for exactly how the situation is better now that youre working there.

If youre in an industry where theres some mobility then theyll realise that it may be worth giving you a raise to keep their productivity up.

If youre confident that the company realises the benefit you provide them then you should be fine. If it really isnt possible for them to give you anything right now then at least get a formal evaluation and pay review on the calendar for your one year mark.","1"

- Some source of natural light, an opening window is definitely a bonus
  - Being able to know what time of day it is and get some fresh air makes for a much more enjoyable experience.
- A good chair
  - A few years ago I invested in a [Herman Miller Embody](http://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/performance-work-chairs/embody-chairs.html) after getting some consistent lower back pain from my old chair. Having a good work position is vital to being productive I think and to your long term health.
- A computer/desk setup that works for you
  - Due to my nature of work, I have three monitors, on stands that are at the correct height. I have a mechanical keyboard and a good mouse. What you need will be up to you, and it might take some time to sort out what you really do need. As someone who sits here typing for hours upon hours, an overall comfortable setup is key. Nothing should be giving you pain after long hours. Neck pain? Maybe your monitors are too low. Sore wrists? Maybe your mouse or keyboard isn't working for you. etc
- Personally, a visually interesting space
  - I don't want to be sitting in a white box all day so I tend to have lots of art work, nicely painted walls, etc
  - Side bonus is that if you're on a lot of video calls, it's good to have a nice background so it doesn't look to others like you're working in a bed etc. :)

------

My space has evolved over the years and grown as I've needed but I'd say those are the main things that I'm looking for or have done to my office space.

In the future I'd like to try out a standing desk that can be lowered to sitting so that I can try *not* sitting as much as I do. Just haven't saved up what's needed for the frame yet ;)

* **Standing desk** - Needs to be adjustable. I love my [Jarvis Bamboo](https://www.fully.com/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html).

* **Good chair** - Where you're going to be spending a lot of time when not standing. Why not invest in something comfortable and ergonomically sound? I went with a used Herman Miller Aeron.

* **Good monitors and monitor arms** - Investing in some decent monitors make a world of difference for readability, color reproduction etc... I purchased 2 Dell U2715H monitors. If you hunt around, you can find good deals. Went with 2x [Amazon Basics Single Monitor Arms](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Single-Monitor-Display-Mounting/dp/B00MIBN16O). 

* **Quality input devices** - Lots of opinions and personal preferences around this one. My job is in tech so I do a lot of code writing/typing, and a quality keyboard is important to me. I use a mechanical keyboard: KBC Poker II with Cherry MX blue switches. Mouse is an Anker ergonomic mouse. I'm using [Imak ergo-beads wrist/keyboard rests](https://www.amazon.com/Imak-A10161-Keyboard-Cushion-Grey/dp/B001GAOHOI/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1490648313&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=ergobeads)  as well.

* **Natural light** - I think being able to see outside and experience natural light is a huge psychological benefit. Obviously not an option for everyone, but if you can make sure your office has an outside-facing window.

* **Quality speakers/headphones** - Budget and preference rule here, but music is a huge part of my work day. 


Future plans/upgrades include whiteboards, some in-wall shelving and cabinets, and another desk. I'd also like to add some photos, art, and possibly a plant or two to spice it up a bit. 

Some of the stuff I mentioned above *is* expensive, but I think it's more than worth the investment, particularly when you consider how much time you'll spend at your workstation during the course of a day(~8 hours or more).

1) The room isn't enclosed...since it's a loft the walls for my office and our bedroom are about 3' from the ceiling. During the day this is fine, but I'm working before my husband leaves, working when he gets home, and sometimes trying to work on the weekends. I'm surprised how much I miss having a regular room with a door when I can be as loud as I want, when I want.  
And 2) As mentioned in other posts, natural light. This is a big problem for me, and it's the reason we're moving when our lease is up. I thought it would be fine since the walls have that gap, but the indirect light is not enough and I really really miss having an open window on nice days.

My desk is the correct height for standing, but I also have a nice Herman Miller chair that we built into a stool, because I just can't stand all day.

It's helpful with managing the hundreds of days off the kids have from school (they've got a 4.5 day weekend still happening now with only a month of school left) and avoiding paying daycare every day.  You'd think there'd be more time for cooking and exercise but that takes a lot of discipline which is hard to maintain when lonely, anxious, busy with work and raising children. Quiet space is good for focus but bad for making a person feel like they're part of something.  There's trade offs all around.  You won't have any friends in person but you also can wake up later and wear sweatpants all day.  I don't like giving advice anymore these days but I will say this:  it's not for the faint of heart, is not as easy as they'd have you believe and you're going to spend a lot of time alone.  Your life will be different and it'll be up to you to decide how to spend your time and when to stop your work for the day.  If you start feeling really anxious and depressed then you need to actively fight those feeling with therapy and actions that'll alleviate those feelings.  See a doctor if you can't handle it and get some tools (CBT, meds, meditation, exercise) to make yourself last.  It really is a blessing for those of us with kids who are predisposed to hating commutes and office culture, but there is nobody around, it will make you sad and it'll be up to you to figure out how to fill that void without becoming a drug addict.  Sorry if that's negative but people have rose colored glasses and ignore the dark side to being isolated for such long stretches of time.","2"

I once had a half hour conversation with a company (it was even local!) that seemed like a great fit. Everything they asked for, I'd done. The company was doing good things. I liked the dude I chatted with on the phone. 

And then we brought up money. Turns out that their budget was half what I required. I don't know which of us was more disappointed, since we'd each gotten our hopes up. And it's a half hour I could have spent doing something productive.

But in regard to this article: I think it says more about ""what people would do to telecommute"" than it does about what employers expect to pay. In reality, I find that employers who support remote work pay about the same as they do for in-person talent.

It's all about the impression you give off. If my projects are going well and clients are happy then I'll happily call them from the beach with the sounds of the waves crashing in the background. They'll think I'm dynamic and successful. All good.

However that same call takes on a totally different meaning if a project is behind or if I'm speaking to one of my team that's having a shitty day. If I'm telling a client there is a delay in getting something to them they won't be impressed if they think I'm pissing about and having fun rather then working properly.

I suppose part of the problem is not knowing the full context of what's going on, especially difficult if you're removed from the situation. Furthermore if other people are working from an office it can be rubbing their noses in it if you're in a coffee shop and if it inconveniences them because of the noise then it's even worse. You have to treat remote working as a privilege to guard, not a right to flaunt.

Now I err on the side of caution and try to make my calls from home. If I get an unexpected call I'll try and go somewhere quiet and if that's not immediately possible I'll apologise for the noise, tell them I'm just out and offer to call back if they prefer.

Sometimes it's not even deliberate.

To the point where in at least a few cases I downed tools, walked over, and told a couple of members of upper management that if they were going to be so loud I couldn't hear the other end of conversations on my own desk phone, they could remove themselves from the floor entirely and, ideally, permanently.

Because they simply did not consider that them walking into an area where people are trying to use phones and/or concentrate on what they're doing, and proceeding to hold a loud conversation, could in any way be a problem.","5_2"

I tend to WFH one day a week, most weeks, sometimes two days.

2. I work on a team, so we are in constant communication to bounce ideas off one another. We do work tickets so the actual problem solving is usually solo unless it's a real bad issue.

3. Best part is the money saved and the time saved. Now I do 8 hours of work for my yearly salary. Before I did 8 hours of work, 1 hour of lunch(paid or prepared), and 1 to 2 hours of commuting and preparing. Wear and tear on nice work clothes, tolls, stress from driving, etc.

Cons are no face to face communication. But none of the cons come close to the pros IMO

2. Coordinate with coworkers via email, chat, and video conferences

Pros

* Freedom from social stresses of the office. For example, I used to hate using the bathrooms at work because it felt awkward. 
* Ability to open the window if the weather is nice (also having a window to have natural light).
* Easy to eat a good lunch (no packing a shitty lunch and worrying about it spilling on the way to work, or finding space in the work fridge), also making supper ahead of time is easy, you can start a dish in the oven during the afternoon if it takes a while to cook.
* Office can be noisy and distracting
* Pets at home help make the work day nicer (but sometime I have to kick my cat off my desk when he tries to lay on my keyboard)
* No commuting


Cons

* May be harder to get promotions/recognition (I was the logical choice to be promoted to lead my team, but was passed over for someone located in the office.)
* Can feel socially isolating, but I occaisionally work from a coffee shop to combat this
* Coworkers in the office require some training/coaching on how to communicate over video chat clearly (multiple people in the same room with their mikes unmuted, not being in frame on the video chat, bad mike making it hard to understand people, etc)
* Missing out on office news that is transmitted by people's loose interactions (eg, water cooler conversations)
* Harder to get tech support from IT department","2"

2.) I do not have any partners, nor employees, as I work independently.

3.) Pros - You have flexibility in your schedule, aren't stressed by A-hole coworkers. Also, if I'm at home and take a break, I'll get caught up on laundry, etc. You also save on gas money and help the environment out by driving less.

Cons - Some people get lonely and miss the human interaction. I'm not saying I do, but some do :)","3"

i love it, basically. being a programmer i hate pointless work and that's what it is to put on business clothes and commute. the more bullshit i strip away from the work day, the more i get done.  daily standups and weekly all hands are a must though, this can get extremely isolated without regular contact of some sort with your coworkers.","4"

I, and a team of other devs, are (were) re-writing a website that was written by an outsourced shop (it was scary in there).  We occasionally fix bugs in the old software when the cost in time will not be ""too high"" (a subjective term).
2. We use GoToMeeting for a morning update meeting, Slack to chat with one another, GitHub to store our source code, and Outlook.com for email.  Additionally we use Jira for issue tracking, and Confluence for our internal documentation.
3.  There are some difficulties for me, and none of them are performance problems.  Working in an office and having more direct contact with coworkers makes it a much more social activity.  Knocking off for lunch, having Nerf gun fights when things slow down, pranking the boss by changing the layout of the keys on his keyboard, these are all things that are lost when working from home.  I live in Hawaii, and there are very few developers over here, so it is hard to go have a drink and talk shop.  Next, I like working at night, but we have a meeting in the morning that we have to be in on.  Rather than work early morning to mid morning (which would not work out very well) I end up working a more or less normal 7-3.  I get a lot done, what I would call a normal workload, but I have found that the isolation that comes in the dead of night can be a real work booster.


One of my real worries is what I am going through now.  I am looking for work having just had the company dissolve out from under me.  There is next to no software work on the island (and any that is here is not willing to pay me what I am looking for considering the amount of work they are talking about).  With so few local opportunities, and being so far flung from the mainland, there is very little that I can do to ""network"".  It has been years since I was able to attend a software conference (where I would wager the majority of networking outside of ones company takes place).  This has left me pretty isolated.  I would say, make sure that you have the opportunity to meet others in your field in person.  Hopefully my next employment will let me go to conferences (not only for the networking, but there is a HUGE professional development aspect to it too).

As far as specific things regarding working at home:
*  DO NOT work in your underwear or sleepwear or naked.  Dressing the part helps put you in the state of mind that there is work to be done and that you need to get to it.  Also, do not roll out of bed and jump into clothes and get to work.  Take a shower, loosen up, maybe even do some stretching assuming you are not going to work out.  There is a lot to be said for getting the blood flowing to the old brain.
*  Make absolutely clear to spouse, roommates, children, etc, that when you are at your computer between this hour and that hour, you are at work.  You are not making lunch for the whole family, you are not doing the laundry, you are not cleaning, you ARE working.
*  If you get the sense that your manager is suspicious that you are slacking off (and I hope that is not the case), start keeping a more detailed record of what you are doing.  ""I spent all day debugging the Notification Manager"" is not nearly as good as ""I spent the day debugging the Notification manager, except for the hour that I spent helping the designer implement this new function, and another hour tracking down a problem that QA brought up that turned out to be a problem with their install procedure"".  In that last case you have shown that 1/4 of your time was spent helping someone else.
*  Did the dog just vomit on the floor outside your office?  Are the kids banging pots and pans in the kitchen?  Has the microwave been alerting someone that their food is ready every minute for the last half hour?  Reiterate that you need to be left alone and that means that you need the privacy of quiet, as best as it can be provided.
*  Be comfortable.  If you like the office well lit or dark, make it so.  If it is too warm, cool it, if it is too cool, warm it.  Don't sit at your desk sweating buckets, your productivity will suffer.  If you have been working somewhere for a while, you might even be able to get them to spring for a little comfort.  A small space heater, a portable cooler, a nicer chair, etc","5"

Thanks to Skype, I now work 100 percent from my very rural home office, here in the rugged and beautiful Arizona mountains.  My ""break room"" is our outdoor deck, where my wife and I get to watch all the furry and feathered wild creatures who come to drink from our pond.  It's a hoot.  :D

Try breaking your day into three or four 2.5 hour work periods. Turn off your phone and cut out all distractions during those work periods and make sure you get active on at least one of your breaks each day. ","4"

I really do hope the number of people working remotely is increasing because it means more employers are understanding people dont need to be in an office to be productive. Right now, i feel like a full time telecommuting position with normal salary is a chance of a lifetime.

My colleagues in the same position are spread cross the country and have to do it all from home.

I like going in because I have a desk, atmosphere and a team feeling sometimes but I can stop in and leave whenever I want. Pplus free office supplies and all the copying I wanted.
