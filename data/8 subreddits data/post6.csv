"2019-11-07",1573086568,"Interview about work-life balance &amp; remote work with Marcus Wermuth, Engineering Manager at social media management software company Buffer","Hey guys,

I've been interviewing a range of people, including CEOs, startup founders, managers, etc. about work-life balance. 

The purpose of these interviews are to highlight how people from all walks of life, whether they're a CEO, freelancer, startup founder, can do their job successfully and still manage to spend quality time with their family, exercise, eat right, relax, and more.

Below is an interview with Marcus Wermuth, Engineering Manager at Buffer, a fully remote company, about his workflow, how he manages the balance between work and life, and more.

&amp;#x200B;

## 1) To kick things off, could you tell us a little about your career background and current role?

Yes totally. I come from a very technical background, and was a freelancer developing iOS and Android Applications for 5-6 years. Ive worked with different teams and small startups and mostly worked remotely  that means never sitting in the same office or place my clients or colleagues worked in.

Then over 4 years ago I started at Buffer as an iOS engineer. I was quite a fan of Buffer, their transparency, their culture and of course their fully distributed setup.

After roughly 1 1/2 years I fell into the roll of becoming the manager of the Mobile Team. And since then have been learning more and building more skills around management and leadership and what that means in a remote company.

As the Engineering Manager I do 1:1s, help build the strategy for the team and build the best and most effective team I can.

## 2) What does a day in the life look like for you? Can you take us through a recent workday?

I wake up after at least 8 hours of sleep, normally that is around 7am but it depends when I go to sleep. I am very intentionally about this (read *Why we Sleep*  it changed my life).

Next thing is taking a shower and walking my dog. While I walk my dog I normally listen to an audiobook, mostly fiction, as I prefer to read non-fiction as I can take notes much easier.

After around 20 mins we are back home and its coffee time. I am a big coffee nerd so that time is very important, I usually brew a V60 in the morning, and the grinding sound and smell has become sort of a morning ritual.

At around 8am I have my oatmeal with coffee and start the day by catching up on things, Twitter, LinkedIn, email and other articles I wanted to check out. Until 12:30pm I have mostly heads down time, as most of team is in North America.

I answer requests, emails and document any new thoughts. After lunch with my wife at home, I spend the time either reading or doing something for my own personal brand: writing an article, working on my website, preparing a talk or similar things.

My afternoons from 3pm to 6:30pm are mostly filled with various calls, either one-to-ones with my team or other project and team meetings. After I am done with my last call, if my wife didnt walk the dog yet, I use that to get out of the house again and catch some fresh air.

Once dinner is done, and it is a normal weekday we spend most of that time reading some kind of book. We just recently canceled Netflix and Amazon Prime to use more time together or read.

## 3) Does your current role allow for flexible or remote working? If so, how does that fit into your life and routine?

Great question  yes all the time. Buffer is a [fully remote company](https://www.balancethegrind.com.au/remote-work/flexibility-structure-what-22-people-think-about-remote-flexible-working/), we dont have an office and have people in a lot of different countries and cities  from Australia to the west coast of the USA. As most of my professional work life has been spend working remotely, I cant see myself work in any other way.

## 4) Do you have any tips, tricks or shortcuts to help you manage your workload and schedule?

Be honest to oneself. Over committing is something that we tend to fall it pretty easily, especially if we like our job and care for it. I learned it the hard way, that having to many things going on at the same time is just not possible and in the long run will wear you out. Saying no to things is a skill and we all can learn it. For me its the secret to a great work life.

## 5) What does work-life balance mean to you and how do you work to achieve that goal?

Something I am thinking about a lot. On one hand I am not sure if there is something as a clear line between work and life. Both things influence the other and that makes it difficult to understand or see the line in between them.

In my opinion if you do like your job it becomes even harder to see or cope with as you start to think about your passion or work also in the life part. For me [work-life balance](https://www.balancethegrind.com.au/work-life-balance/your-ultimate-guide-to-achieving-a-healthy-work-life-balance/) means that I have a flexible schedule to be around my family, to travel with them and to allow us to focus on life when we need to.

It also means that I do work on something that I enjoy and that I am passionate about.

## 6) What do you think are some of the best habits youve developed over the years to help you strive for success and balance?

I am not sure you could call them habits, but I think two things come to mind here. One is that I discovered writing for me. Ive never been a fan of writing  I hated it in school  but lately Ive been really enjoying writing more. It has helped to share more of my thoughts online and maybe even help others.

The other one is about self reflection, something I learned by becoming a manager and being very interested in psychology (my wife is a psychologist, so I am biased).

It allowed me to really look back on things and my behavior in situations where I wanted to change or improve it. I can really recommend to learn more about it, and figure out how you work  it has been super helpful.

## 7) Are there any books that have helped you improve over the years?

That is difficult for me to answer, because there are a lot of books that I read and enjoyed! In terms of management and work I would say the following are pretty great:

1. *The Five Dysfunctions of a Team* by Patrick Lencioni
2. *Why We Sleep: The New Science of Sleep and Dreams* by Matthew Walker
3. *Dare to Lead: Brave Work. Tough Conversations. Whole Hearts.* by Brené Brown
4. *Ego is the Enemy* by Ryan Holiday
5. *The Culture Code: The Secrets of Highly Successful Groups* by Daniel Coyle

## 8) What is the number one thing you do to make sure you get the most out of your day?

I always have a notebook in front of me. Normally I am a very technical person but for writing, and notes nothing beats a fountain pen and paper. Its not so much about journaling but more so about having a place where you can park your thoughts or take a quick note.

It has become quite essential for me when preparing for meetings, or scribbling down a short reminder. All of that gets processed later into my long term note storage or my to-do app.

## 9) Do you have any last thoughts on work, life or balance that youd like to share with our readers?

In todays world of virtual collaboration, whether that is in a distributed team or not, we mostly chat online, or talk to avatars in video calls. I hope that we dont forget there are humans behind those avatars and that we should care about building better relationships.

It is a topic I am very passionate about and hope to write more in the future. Feel free to reach out to me if you want to know more or just talk.

"2019-01-17",1547758449,"Balancing wellness at work","# Dimensions of Wellness

With the new year starting, wellness is on everybodys mind (at least for the first few weeks). I was taught that there are twelve dimensions of wellness. I like to group the dimensions into three categories in relation to wellness for **employees**: 

* Factors are from within a person including: Joy, Spirituality, Creativity, Home Cooking (and their relationship to food being nourishment), Health and Physical Activity
* Factors are from work/coworkers including: Social life, Finances, Career, Education, and 
* Factors come from other people and relationships including: Social life (again), Relationships, Home Environment (and Home Cooking listed for themselves) 

The way these dimensions work together are very different for each person. Certain dimensions are dependent on each other. Thats ok, because in life and wellness, nothing is independent totally. 

For example: Exercise too little and your health declines. Exercise too much and your body cannot recover causing a potential injury or physical fatigue and your health declines. It is always relative to you. 

# Finding Your Wellness Balance 

The truth is we want all areas in our life to be perfect. The second truth is, they will NEVER ALL be perfect at the same time. The third truth, is that you are putting more PRESSURE on yourself than anyone else. So lets try and get comfortable with the relative (not absolute) nature of wellness. Its how the gluten-free cookie crumbles. 

When work is busy and motivating, you may have less time for your social life or cooking at home. Some weeks, I can acknowledge I did not reach my target, but at the same time I can forgive myself and try next time. 

What is important to discover is your personal baseline for each dimension. Each dimension is a moving target and all we should do is TRY. OUR. BEST.

# Take a Horse to Water 

It would be unfair if I didnt mention that all of this takes time, trial and many errors, to understand the needs of your team members and to adapt to your evolving company culture. We failed many times before we succeeded. 

When you take the time and resources to favor wellness you implicitly tell your colleagues that they should too, value their wellness. What works for all of us is having the option to put our health first, with healthy snacks and workouts, but to be allowed the freedom to break the rules and eat chips (on Fridays).

I've been interviewing a range of people, including CEOs, startup founders, managers, etc. about work-life balance.

The purpose of these interviews are to highlight how people from all walks of life, whether they're a CEO, freelancer, startup founder, can do their job successfully and still manage to spend quality time with their family, exercise, eat right, relax, and more.

Below is an interview with Miguel San Román, Senior Product Engineer at Buffer, a fully remote company.

&amp;#x200B;

**1) To kick things off, could you tell us a little about your career background and current role?**

Since I was a teenager, Ive been in love with web development and computers. The moment I saw a few lines of HTML transform into a website was a revelation!

I got involved in a very short-lived startup while I was in university, and from there, I transitioned to work on a web development agency for a few years, with some freelancing on the side.

All that put together in a short span of fewer than three years gave me a ton of experience: working with big and small clients alike, as well as handling different projects (from WordPress templates to huge online magazines, to a few web apps), and Ive been in love with it all day after day.

Now, Im the founder of Otter with Maria, my partner in life and business, and Im also a senior product engineer at Buffer, working this past couple of years on one of our products, Buffer Analyze.

**2) What does a day in the life look like for you? Can you take us through a recent workday?**

I love to wake up early, as long as Im sleeping enough hours, and have a bit of a quiet morning for myself and not feel like I have to rush out of the door. Recently, when I wake up, I grab a decaf (Im reprogramming myself not to be super caffeinated as soon as I wake up) and meditate for 10 minutes with Muse.

I start my workday working on Otter, at around 9am, either by having some meetings or coding new features on our web app. I like to start the workday with a big personal goal before I jump onto my responsibilities at Buffer.

Then by 11am or so, I shift gears and start working on Buffer. I usually have lunch at around 2pm, so that gives me three hours of uninterrupted time to work on the most important goals I have set up for that day.

Deep work time is where the most valuable output comes from, and that might mean being heads down with a piece of code, or writing some documents for the team.

After lunch, my calendar is sprinkled with meetings. Those meetings range from 1:1s with my manager, mentoring other engineers, and team-wide sessions to brainstorm new things, share the status of the current work in progress, or do a retrospective to grow together.

This schedule also helps me a ton because some of my teammates at Buffer Analyze start their days on my afternoon, and shifting a bit the start of my day for Buffer ensures I have some overlap with them in case we want to brainstorm or pair program on something.

Many people just left wall street for Silicon Valley and the long working hours of banks are suffering. However, with virtual technology, this is changing the industry.

More companies are advocating remote work and the necessity to come to office reduce. With advanced technology like Zoom and Slack, colleagues can communicate virtually and unless client meetings or formal events, there may be no necessity for all colleagues to come to work. This save lots of commuting time and work life balance improves a lot.
