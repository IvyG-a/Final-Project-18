Ive done such trip once, about 3 years ago when I wanted to visit my family in another country for a whole month... I did two weeks to work and 2 weeks for vacation. 
Wifi was the most stressful thing for me... (will it be fast enough?) But given my family gave me clear indication that everything is fine, I was comfortable. I came with a second monitor and think for me its a must, my headphones, extra keyboard, mouse and chargers but I can just imagine having those available there would have been helpful. I had a page with a side by side time zone I saved, because although its easy to calculate its still another thing to think about. 
I came prepared with outlet converters so that is something Id recommend and even a cord extension for extra outlets can be super helpful. From a recent traveler I met, the outlets in a hotel were not positioned where the table in the room was. So that was a pain point and having an outlet power strip can be helpful.","4"

The difference is that instead of trying to find someone to co-work with online when you'd like work buddy, you'll always have a community to plug into when you want the company. 

That's how the idea to do this was birthed. My friend and I were co-working together and it helped me out a TON. I was much more motivated because I had someone holding me accountable and accomplished a lot. Unfortunately, I got a new job and my schedule no longer matched up with hers, so we couldn't keep it up. I thought, ""man what I would give to co-work with somebody, even a stranger.""

Anyway, you can't plug into community now on Zoom (that I'm aware of at least). If you don't make plans to meet someone on the other side, you'll be in the zoom room by yourself. 

Action Room will meet on Zoom to start during business hours. As the community grows, more hours will be added until it's running 24/7. 

Why work silently with the webcam on? It's for the same reason many students choose to work in open spaces at their University library than in a 3x3 private single room. Seeing other students while they silently study motivates them to study.

Anyway, I hope that answers all your questions. 

Also, I checked out your YouTube channel. I love your story and love what you're doing. I subscribed lol.

Your claims auditing experience could land you a remote role with an insurance company. Maybe structure your resume with relevant experience on the first page and put your education at the very end. You could also look into sharpening your HIPAA knowledge, no idea if theres any certs for that.

Now, pandemic gave me the chance to test the work from home: Jesus Christ I was so energised every day and every weekend till late sunday in a way I couldn't even imagined.

I think 15 years record of in-office vs a couple of years working from home can definitely draw a line: lazy people NEED to go to the office otherwise their life is ruined.

Adults that can organise their life, are self-motivated, or, in few words, are grown ups, can work from home with no problem at all.

I go to the gym or walk with a friend before I start my day, volunteer, play a sport, and take turns to organize things for my friend group. My kids are in activities that keep us busy and I let them have friends over whenever (we live right near the school and have become an afternoon hang out) and have gotten to know other parents. If neighbors are out I go talk to them and that turns into impromptu happy hours. If you dont know what to do to meet people do anything until youre a regular. On the walking path I go to a few times a week I see the same people every time and we start to chat. Or the sports team Im on, we grab beers after the game and Ive gotten to know people on other teams as well.","20"

I'm a senior back end developer, and I spent over 6 years working remote for a consulting company that I spent 10 years at. If you're being honest, all of my time there was spent working remote. The clients never met us, and in the times where several of us were on the same team we communicated entirely by messenger / skype. The only problem was once I switched to full remote and moved away I stopped getting competitive raises, and had to quit to get an extra 35k / yr. That meant going back to an office in a company where there's a huge in person culture.
So since covid started I've been working from home and my boss sees the value in working this way. But the CEO thinks anyone he can't see with his own two eyes is on vacation, so there's a massive amount of pressure on my boss to get us back in there. I'm probably going to have to quit because I live in a really large city, and I'm not going to gamble with my life to satisfy the feefees of a multi-millionaire while also reducing my productivity.
My partner and I both want to move somewhere warm and we don't want to wait 15 - 20 years for retirement to do it, so we're planning now to go full remote and take our jobs with us to Portugal / Mexico / Costa Rica or something like that. I just wish the work culture would change a little faster. I keep having headhunters coming at me salivating over my resume, only to find out that their client will not accept a remote worker.","3"

If you gave out very critical information like social security number, bank account info, even reference person's info, then I would highly consider reporting it as possible identity theft.  Keep an eye out for hard inquiries or new credit cards opened in your name.

Good luck I hope they didn't get anything useful out of you.","19"

Agree with most of the points you make.

For my personal routine though, I never get the dressing up part that a lot of people recommends.  I guess I seldom need to video conference (most of my meetings don't require turning on camera), so I fully enjoy not dressing up when working remote.  To me when I get to my ""work"" desk, it's work time no matter what I'm dressed in.

Also, I don't feel working from home is lonely.  On the other hand, I love the lack of immediate distractions (co-workers coming to my desk to ask for something, especially something not urgent).  Those distractions disrupt my flow and I'll need to spend time to get back to the task.  When I'm working from home, at least I can delay replying to instant messages, slack messages, email... etc.

Anyways, I realize different people have different work style, so keep doing whatever works for you!","2"

Full genome sequencing with polygenic scoring can provide deep insight into various features of one's personal psychology that would seem of critical importance when considering the loneliness etc of remote work. People are different and offering generic advice across these differences is typically not helpful. Genetics now allow us to quantify these differences.  

My full genome sequence and accompanying polygenic scores offered me an enormous amount of insight into who I am. The information that can now be reported can provide pivotally important insights into which friends, mates, jobs, communities etc. would be optimal for you. When you look around and notice how often life does not work out for people, it should not be overly surprising to you now that you understand that people have typically never had the ability to probe the polygenic genomes of themselves or their mates. Using genetics to your advantage could profoundly improve the quality of your life and that of your family and friends.

There were many important and surprising findings from my genome sequence. For example, my full genome sequence had a GWAS polygenic score for the loneliness trait. I scored at the \~10th percentile. What meaning does a 10th percentile score in loneliness have? I **never** feel alone; **never ever**. I suppose it could be said that in social interaction terms I am quite low maintenance.

{Note: I genotyped through Nebula Genetics who offer a full genome service for \~$300 with dozens and dozens of polygenic scores provided. Over the near term full genome sequencing is expected to fall to \~$100.}

I think knowing one's polygenic loneliness score among others is of vital importance. I could well imagine that those who were not at the 10th percentile but closer to the 90th percentile on the loneliness score would likely have a very different psychological response to remote living. Genetics offers the potential to help people find their comparative advantages and thrive in those environments which value such traits.","6"

Recently my department grew, and they hired 3 junior employees for me to coach and supervise.

Now, the employees they hired moved 90km away from the office we are at so they could be classified ""fully remote""... I did not get such classification however. So, every week, I have to go into the office for my mandatory 3 in person days, spend $200 a week on the 407 to get there, so I can setup my things at a hotel station and train these three employees over Microsoft teams.

So I sit in the office alone, trying to train and supervise these employees when often I am sure they aren't even at their desk. They sign off at random intervals for hours, have their kids on the calls with them (inside of hiring a babysitter), and basically I sit in an office building and try to manage them making the same exact pay as them.

I have asked my boss for a promotion: Nope. I have asked my boss to work remotely as well: Nope. I have mentioned to my boss that certain employees are working 3 hour days instead of 8, he says ""make sure you support them"".

As I write this, I am getting ready get up early to drive into work tomorrow so I can sit isolated in an office and wait for them to sign online whenever in their PJs, while they make breakfast for their family and have the TV running in the background.","8"

I saw they also have some bootcamps for the QA tester role, which also requires learning some coding but not the same level as a developer. I personally don't know anyone who's done the boot camp in NC, but if the boot camp offers help with job placement, it might be a good program.

Big things is to not conflate job positing with actual positions.   Remote positions don't turn over as much, so there's not as much churn.   

Yes, some companies do require people to be in the same state as the employer, usually for tax and benefit reasons.   Hopefully, they're being up front about any requirements in their job descriptions /postings so you're not applying unnecessarily.  

There are a lot of job platforms in general and remote/hybrid specific such as FlexJobs, but I'd also go directly to employer sites and look for available jobs.  You might find that there's less competition for jobs that way, and you may get better quality positions (and eliminate spam/scams).","40"

We find ourselves in the middle of a narrative war powered by self-interest and the inescapable wave of change. Every day you'll see articles and news clips about WFH being good or bad, productive or not, negatively impacting mental health or boosting it, etc. Like with any media, assume a level of bias and ask where the information is steering you and for what reason.

My opinion (not that you asked)? WFH is here to stay, but hybrid will be most prevalent for most people who have the option. Organizations who adapt to WFH will be in the minority, but it will change within a generation. Big commercial leasing will be squeezed and the economics of office workers will inevitably shift. It will take time, some will adapt and succeed, some will not.","42"

Their feedback is that it works best through a hybrid, that either extreme doesnt achieve the best balance of outcomes. 
Younger team members prefer a fully remote, but what they dont learn are organisational norms, nor is there a knowledge transfer as effective as when they work with a more senior/experienced member of a team. Conflict resolution development doesnt grow as easily as people will hide behind their keyboards and either avoid difficult conversations, or have them take way longer than they should. When people arent pushed to develop, they are fine, but if you are pushing an employee to grow in their role it isnt as effective because they will sit at home and drown in a problem for longer than they would in the office - why?

Just wanted to add that at my workplace we do a 'hybrid work model' that actually is working like a new mantra because when we need to collaborate not just on a platform but in person we do so by simply blocking our space and time and make sure it is still safe to go to office. We deploy '[*WorkinSync*](https://www.workinsync.io/)' not just to collaborate at work but also leverage my work timings, my availability, my food requirements, extra assets that I might need and soo much more.

1. The old tech giants like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft are not going to take this brain-drain quietly. They will still insist that #5 (face-to-face) is mission-critical. So what do they do? They will amp up compensation in various forms. And for some people, this will be just fine as either a) their social network is their office or b) the commute and other negatives aren't so bad. But look for overall the competition for talented people to get hotter. Hooray!
2. Your issue #5 is very real. I miss white-boarding with people when words are not working. At the moment, the replacement tech is just nowhere close to the same experience.  I expect that to change. But I still expect there to be some value in the unplanned, unscheduled interactions. Doing frequent get-togethers has a different value and function. My hunch is many will start to find central locations e.g. ""within 3 hours of Seattle"" or similar to offset this. I fully accept this case is not true for everyone by the way, some folks hated those white-board sessions as it wasn't their ideal collab modality.

Last but not least, the way we do taxes worldwide, healthcare in the US, and visas is going to be stretched in this brave new world. Navigating the byzantine US employment and healthcare rules on a state-by-state business is awful. More challenging is healthcare. I fully expect some smart companies to start working through this \*and\* for some smart countries to get their act together and sort it out. But it isn't quite that simple yet.

Like you have 4 different Field careers listed basically, so to me you probably appear to be a generalist to recruiters. You have some great skills, dont get me wrong and each can make you a great addition to the companies. 

But your resume should be tailored to each role, so if you are going after tax, accounting - keep the other stuff off your resume as its not as relevant. For example, if you applied for some accounting role but most of your resume had marketing, recruiting, video editing, and coding, Id be kinda confused or think you are a career hopper. Instead, Id look for someone with all accounting/tax/bookkeeping related roles and customer service would be okay as it ties together. 

Maybe you already do tailor these resumes, but just something Id suggest if not. Being more personalized and focus goes further.

What else are you doing to stand out? You have to remember many jobs get hundreds, if not thousands of applications. Many more want to work remotely to, so you need some edge to give yourself a better shot. 

Hang in there and keep going, youll find something great! Good luck and hope some of the above helps!","3_1_1"

I'm not gonna lie it took me a few months to find my first work but I did. From there on, it was like a snowball effect. I started to have invitation for interview and now it's much easier to find work.

All you need to do is find that one client that will pay you for what you're worth. It can be difficult to find that one client but as long as you're persistent, know how to write a good proposal and have a good resume then you maximize your chances.

When I joined the platform, I literally made $0 in 3 months. But I kept going and after now 3 years, I've made $XX,XXX and I've been able to maintain a JSS of 100% and just became top-rated plus.

And 85%+ of that was because of that ONE client that believed in me with who I've worked for a year.

Video calls are so artificial and since callers are in different environments, you don't share the same experience which play a big part in being human.

Here's my list:

1)  Work in the library or coffee shop.  I've gotten addicted to the library because I can get up and take a break and go look for some books.  You are unlikely to start talking to people unfortunately, but just being around other humans helps just a little.

2) Take a mid-day yoga class - I started yoga in 2019 and was crushed when 2020 rolled around.  Yoga is a great for combating sitting around all day, mental health, and being around other people.  

3) Volunteer - I've been volunteering for a radio station since 2018.  I've had some events happen during the work day, and I slipped out of remote work and did my volunteer work.  These events I do are super social and I find it so good for my mental health.  Most of the events happen at night or on the weekends, but I have had some during the day.

4) Find a hobby that requires you to be social.  -  I currently attended salsa classes a few times a week.  Most of them are at night, but there are some during the day.  I also do DJ classes online and have met up with some of the virtual students over the years I've been doing it.

5) Find a team sport - basketball, pickleball, tennis doubles, volleyball.  

6) Have a lunch date with your friends who also remote work - I've been bad about this.  I've only done it a few times since March 2020.  I am going to do it more now that I wrote this.  


7) Travel -  I've done a trip to Mexico and remote work and it was such a great experience living as a digital nomad for a bit.  If I did not have a GF, I would be traveling 70% of the time.

I like remote work, but wish my job was a bit more hybrid.  Ideally I would have a job that requires me to come in 1-2 a week.  But I'm not complaining with what I got!","12"

If people go for walks in your neighborhood, join them. Good to know your neighbors anyway.

I have heard of people going to these places where you can go and work remote. Meet others there. Some are free to go to. (If you have lots of meetings I would not suggest that.)

Some local small coffee shops I have heard people going to and working. Also small sandwich places as well. Maybe some city center that has places outdoors is an option.

There is a website meetup.com that may have groups for people that WFH. Had one local to me that lasted two meetings.

Being able to be alone and not get ""board"" is important for working from home.

Your routine all depends on the type of job you have and what you do for a living. If you're trading stocks it might be much different than if you're working the live chat for a website that sells essential oils and knitting patterns.

ETA: There are a couple schools of thought on establishing a clear ""work space"" and a ""relax space"" in your own house or apartment. Some people don't like the two to mix and prefer to draw a very clear line, ie: ""I never answer e-mails from my couch because that's where I relax after work"". Other people find that mixing things up can provide more variety and stimulation. I do most of the work from the desk in my office, including the big projects, meetings, presentations etc. But I also find it nice to do some work from my outside patio, the kitchen table, the porch, etc. Being outside while collecting a decent salary makes me feel like I'm getting the most out of the remote work situation.","1"

honestly i know it's a bit of a waste of the remote situation but i try to get my 9-5 in pretty strictly, otherwise it's very difficult for me to feel like i can fully relax and do other stuff in the evenings because i keep getting that antsy feeling. i have app blockers on constantly the entire work day (i use https://www.opal.so/, both the chrome extension + app, it's pretty good because on deep focus mode i can't turn the blockers off). as a tip, i'd say treat your scheduled breaks very, very seriously. 

  
my schedule still isn't optimal, but at present it's: 8:30am wake up (morning routines + checking slack + breakfast), 9am sit down at desk to work, 12-1pm take a walk in lieu of lunch (i only eat breakfast and dinner), work until 5pm, check slack+emails until 5:30pm, log off. i don't really take too many breaks because i prefer working in long stretches to remain in flow.","10"

Your question is the reason I joined this subreddit, in the hopes of finding out the same answers.

I recently started a sole proprietorship, so my experience may be different than yours because I can set my own schedule. I found 2 hour blocks and 20 minute breaks were a good fit. If you do set your own schedule for the work, try to finish the work as early in the day as possible. I got into a bad habit of working in the evening, which resulted in the work creeping later and later, eventually I was going to bed at 4am and waking up around noon. The work still was completed, but I hated this cycle as I love being awake in the morning. 

The disadvantage to working In smaller chunks is that you sometimes arent letting yourself get into a flow state, where the really good work often happens.

A big issue for me was structure - Id always had some external structure imposed on my life either by school or work, and I found the lack of one disorienting. You really have to focus on creating your own structure (meal times, exercise times, work times, etc.) otherwise youll feel lost. Again, you might have to log in and log out at set times with your job, so this might not be as much of an issue for you - the days you go into the office will help with this.

You have to focus on socializing more - were social animals, after all. I found working fully remote was somewhat isolating. Losing daily interaction with co workers face to face certainly has a large effect. Make sure you take time to be physically around people sometimes. Having a significant other around is nice, but make sure you dont only spend time with them! Make an effort to see friends regularly.

Thats about all I can think of","16"

""What are you really REALLY good at.""

Think of LinkedIn as a marketplace of talent. Most IT folks usually have one or two dozen different skills or technologies and experiences, but that doesn't tell a hiring manager on how good they are. I used to focus on ""jack-of-all"" trades, but master of none. 

That didn't get me far, nor command the salary, and benefits I wanted.


Start by asking yourself what is the number one skill you have over anybody else, or what makes you the top 10% if not the top 1% in the world with that skillset. That's your story and your narrative. Then find two more skills that augment and support that skill.

This answers the ""Why hire me factor."" The better you can convince a hiring manager casually viewing your profile that you are the right fit for the job, the sooner you will get LinkedIn Direct Messages.

LinkedIn Premium also helps gain insight into what kind of people are looking for you and under what search criteria. 

For example, perhaps Recruiters are searching for Cisco Firewall or a specific type of networking engineer, and while you can do that, focus on what you want to do, and you can decide if other opportunities are worth entertaining.

Spend time looking at similar profiles to your own. Compare your own and ask yourself, what do you like about your peers, what don't you like?

Are you not getting traction on your profile? Post something? Engage in conversation, find a community to speak your voice. Professionals will quickly tell a lot about your experience and knowledge, from your opinions.

Always respond to recruiters, promptly and with kindness about any opportunities they bring you. They will remember how you treated them, and can present more relevant opportunities in the future.

I haven't written what most people consider to be ""real code"" since I graduated from bootcamp, and pretty much any entry-level ""engineer"" job you get into isn't going to expect you to write much either. I mostly work with Terraform IaC, which means mostly copying and editing templates we already have, where all the actual hard work is already done.

Since you already have networking experience, I'd suggest learning the fundamentals of IaC. You can set up a VM/VPN at home and just goof around with it while you're learning.

I would personally recommend that you do NOT give a full two weeks notice \[my favorite piece of life advice I've ever been given basically comes down to:  Never craft a well thought out argument to someone John Brown would have shot and never give 2 weeks notice to a job that makes you miserable.\]

At one job I liked \[better situation practically fell in my lap\], I negotiated a 3-week gap between the jobs, gave 2 weeks notice and then took a week for myself.

Its best to hold on and search for another job. I suggest you invest in yourself and get certifications that perhaps get you into a field that better suites your needs. I no longer work service or call center jobs as I am now in tech and no one bothers me so long as my work is done and it gets done very well. I think were all adults here and micromanagement may just run people off more so than it does increase productivity to increase revenue. If youre running everyone off with poor micromanagement it costs more to hire and train again and again in the long run and bites at your revenue. If they wanted robots to do the jobs then hire AI. Ive seen some cool AI call centers. I dont agree as I prefer humans work jobs but I also prefer adults treat one another as & adults. I would have left quickly. Most wealthy folks move around when they notice red flags. Staying put in one place usually doesnt pay well now days. Often moving around has rendered higher pay. If you have red flags at work start planning an exit. Look into jobs postings you desire and what companies require you to have to get those jobs, get more certifications, brush up that resume, put your resume on all job platforms online and network, read more books, attend work events/ job fairs/ or technical conferences in my case, shake hands get numbers, get the hell out. If you do quit find some gigs to hold you down. Get acclimated with head hunters (temp agencies/ contractors) in your field. They will find you a job quickly. I personally dont look for work anymore as Ive set myself up so that jobs come to me and call and blow up my emails.

What I am saying, however, is that going on to a website like this and blanket saying ""I need a job within my location, or I need a job that doesn't require a car"" is equally as broad as ""I need a job where you aren't in a physical locations""

Sure! You can find those jobs and good on you, but don't expect any worthwhile advice that's specifically going to help. And also expect to find many many remote jobs and go in circles. 

Like I said, looking for a remote job is fine, but my advice would be to narrow down specifically what types of jobs and requirements are suited to the individual, rather than just seeking anything under the sun. And if one is seeking everything under the sun, FINE, but don't expect many great returns.","24_2_1_1_1"

I once did a contract for a year with the expectation of getting a full time job + benefits from the company I was working at. I left on the exact date of my one year anniversary without a 2 week notice. The lack of notice wasn't malicious, but I saw a work friend get fired and walked out on the spot when he turned in his two week notice.  So they earned the last minute notices IMO.   


Anyway, 2 days prior my resignation date. They did an interview for all the contractors working at the time for one opening they had. It was well known in the office that I was the number one candidate to get the position by a very comfortable margin. BUT I didn't really care since my contract was for a year and full time position within in a year was my plan. By the time the bosses boss found out. They called me and discovered my starting compensation was about 4%  more than upper end of the budget range and the hiring process would take about 3 months.   


I instead took the new job, used my fancy new medical coverage to get treatment for a knee injury and had made a full recovery long before I would have even gotten medical benefits by staying. Which I had for almost 4 months and had been left untreated because I was making peanuts as a contractor and couldn't afford to go pay a doctor out of pocket to look at it. The ex-employer was not happy about it it all. But by leaving my life took a dramatic turn for the better AND I had abnormally good luck for the next couple of years. 

I had to buy a car for the new job since it involved commuting in a direction that had no mass transit. The sales people at the dealership were pushovers. I managed to negotiate a price so low that he was in almost tears by the end of it.  My monthly payments was so low that it was less than $100 difference compared to monthly transit passes I had to get and those only took me in direction of work. The car insurance company gave me a rate that was barely a third of what I was expecting. The gas prices dropped to the lowest they had been and stayed there for almost the entire duration of my stay at that job. When I got to work, the performance evaluation standards were so different that I was getting pats on the back left and right by doing barely any work compared to previous job.","6_3"

1. Go into the 'in person' office for the week.
2. Be impressive, show the top brass that you know your stuff.
3. Be positive. Talk highly of everyone there, your supervisor and the newbies.
4. Reiterate that you are sincerely interested in becoming permanent.

Remember, if you want to be permanent, the other side must want to make your position permanent. It is a two-way street. So, before the in person session, consider the following:

5. Develop an action plan to become permanent. What were some of the negative feedback? What were the positives?

6. Meet with your supervisor to discuss. Has anything changed since then (business conditions, job description, requirements, etc)?

7. Are there things that you should do to make it a reality? Talk it over with your supervisor. Consider mentioning a time line and a chance to review again in a month or so.Please only discuss your action plan if you believe it is possible to become permanent. If it isn't look for a new position. But, remember you need to leave on good terms so that you will have a good reference to carry forward to your next gig.

This is why I stressed going into the in person office for the week. Something will happen one way or the other; either you will continue to work there or you won't. If you won't (of your own accord or involuntarily) at least you will have left without reason for them to give you a negative reference.

It is your choice. You can take this advice or leave it. It is a tough world out there. I'm gonna take your advice too, and try to tone down my criticalness. So, thanks for being honest with me too! Sometimes the truest, realist advice is the hardest to stomach.  For you though, consider a change in your mindset.

2. Plan before you act, speak, react. If you don't have a plan sit still for a minute. If the plan doesn't present itself, now is not the time to act or speak. 
3. Be a prize fighter. But know your weight class. Don't force a fight with someone beneath or above you.
4. Know your limitations.
5. Be the master of a 6 pronged approach to use any one tool or combination of tools  at your disposal. a) appearance, b) physique, c) intelligence, d) wisdom, e) humility f) courageous ambition/aggression.
6. To help others, lend a hand to yourself first. Be your own best friend.
7. Pray at least 4 times a day. Am/afternoon/diner/pm.
8. Be positive. You can tell this is the hardest for me.
9. Spend at least 1 hour before work and 1 hour after work, working on your own personal goals that will lead to financial independence.
10. One solid dependable man  regardless of profession, looks or trade is worth 100 besties. Choose your mate wisely.","13_1_1_1_1_1_1"

&gt; If someone was worth 180 to your business before with, they're worth 180 to your business now.

Most people aren't getting a salary reduction. Those that are, are definitely not worth what they were being paid now. Remote has really changed the software dev market. So many people who refused to move to HCOL areas now compete with those guys making 180k and they'll work for 140k easily.

&gt;As a business your making money back on reduced/no premises, and all of the costs that come with having a premises.

You keep looking at employment like it's the same as ownership and the business pays you slightly under what you earn them. No, it's the other way around. They pay you what market rate is, based on how replaceable you are.


I am a software developer. I am just aware of what is happening for my own sake. I also work multiple remote jobs so if they want to pay me less that's fine. I just work less and get another job and *both* sides are happy. It's Darwinism. So many simps here shouting and crying.","1_1_2_1"

If you were to pay what they cost, everyone would outsource. That doesn't happen, as there is a value that the employee provides beyond just being cheap as chips. 

An employer pays me for my time, and in exchange, they get service. How much I get paid influences quality of service. 

I'm a software developer too, I consult, remotely and am paid relevant to the value I provide. I am paid extremely well, therefore, I work hard to deliver the best product I can. 

I also run a business. When bringing people on board the question is never what's the cheapest person I can get to do X role, it's who is the best person for X role, and how can I compensate them for being the best.

To me if Google is doing this the way it's been reported I can only imagine that it's a tactic to negatively incentivize employees to return to the office.

In most instances the net financial gain comes with the employer in WFH situations. Employees don't widely understand this yet and therefore don't understand that in many instances you are doing your employer a favor by WFH rather than the other way around.

There is something that triggers senior leaderships on this topic and I can think a couple of things.

One: they dont work in the office or, to tell it better, theyre already flexible in their work schedule. They often travel in corporate jets to meet other people in person, which is good, but they dont spend their life sitting on a crappy chair.

Two: no, they dont commute like everybody else. Probably they dont commute at all.

Three: they dont have an actual life (or the one we mean).  Super CEOs like Google or Apple ones are public people, they cant relate to any extent to what we are facing in the day to day.

Theyre not evil, they just dont know (and dont care) about the true cost of working in an office for their employees.","5_1_1"

\- Why do people talk about remote work as if it didn't exist pre-pandemic? I know several people who had remote careers before 2020 (in HR, accounting, freelance, etc) including myself for a short time (managing an e-comm site for a boutique)

\- How are people still so out of touch with what the majority actually like and dislike about office vs remote vs hybrid work?

\- I understand many roles require some level of in person work- but can we not just assess it on a case by case basis? We're at the point where we have to accept that many jobs function well or even better remotely, also that we're all individual human beings with different work styles, social needs, etc. No one wants to feel trapped somewhere, no matter how many 'fun activities' you shove in their face... it's about autonomy and practicality.

\- My pets, pjs, snacks, and lack of commute will never exist in an office and forced fun and socialization are my worst nightmares.

* Worker dissatisfaction - no exploration of what might be causing that, just a blanket assumption that its because hybrid is failing. Inflation, stagnant wages, record corporate profits, RTO policies forcing people to work in office when they dont want to? None of that came up.
* Very little discussion about how working in office can adversely affect productivity 
* No consideration of employer RTO motives like real estate costs etc 
* No discussion of workers re-evaluating their life priorities and deciding maybe they dont want work to be their everything anymore 
* No discussion on hybrid vs fully remote, or discussion on hybrid models that have actually worked

The other weird thing to me (a former journalist) is that journalism is one of the jobs that makes *so much sense* to be remote.

I always get my assigned tasks done and management has never had a problem with the quality of my work. We don't use time tracking apps, but we do have other ways of tracking what I'm working on (Tickets, project management tools, etc). So management is always aware of what am doing on a day to day basis. I'm also very responsive in our chat apps and email. 

My take  is that if it isn't something you require employees in the office to use then it shouldn't be required for a remote employee.  In the office, managers usually aren't hovering over peoples screens all day getting minute by minute updates of what everyone is working on.  So why should there be a special requirement to do this for remote employees?  

Basically, if managers suddenly don't know what an employee is working on just because they went remote then that is a failure of the management. And there are likely project management issues/ time management issues in the office as well.  Now if you want to require these time tracking apps for all employees then go for it, but don't single remote workers out.","1"

Because if that were the case, they could also work an in-person job and do the homestead afterwards.

The way the OP phrased it makes it sound like they want a work from job so that they can work the homestead during the workday.

Besides, working from home generally does not mean that you have complete flexibility. Entry-level positions like customer service generally require you to be absolutely tied to your computer during your shift. Some of them are even on camera all day long.

And for those of us who have higher level positions, we tend to have a lot of meetings and deliverable deadlines, so we cant just have whatever kind of flexibility we want because we have things at work that we have to do.","2_4_1"

So in short: people with desirable W2 remote roles right now got them by being one of best in their field, and likely highly trained fields where they have the bargaining power to demand remote flexibility (e.g. tech, biotech, IT, executives, consultants).

I agree with many of the points that you make here, as I've been fully remote since the beginning of 2019 and have experienced many of these challenges. The elements that I've found to be *most* effective are:  


1. **Communication and Collaboration** \- my team uses Swit for both chat and task and it's been absolutely wonderful being able to not only minimize the app and tab switching since everything is done in one app but the product is really built for *work transparency.* It's great because you don't have to continue to check in with team members to find out what the current status is on that project; everyone (included in the Task or Channel) can see what the current status is. I think work transparency can be a huge challenge for many companies (remote, hybrid, or in-office) and I don't think enough people are addressing it. 
2. **Asynchronous Communication-** Incredibly useful and supportive for remote tam especially with employees all in different time zones. As long as deadlines and expectations are communicated and all work progress is transparent, this is a total game-changer for remote teams. 
3. **Employee Feedback-** Listening to your employees and taking action on what they communicate with you goes a long way!","2"

My main complaint about Sococo is the screen sharing quality is not quite good enough for sharing detailed text without having to wait for it to clear up often. You can use Zoom for higher quality screen sharing, plus it allows giving remote access to your keyboard and mouse, multiple people can literally work from the same computer. Sometimes when working together via screen sharing, it can surprisingly be an advantage to not have the ability to grant remote access to the keyboard and mouse. This can force you to take turns being the ""driver"". Lookup the rally style of pair programming and mob programming. Even if you are not a programmer, it might be worth trying out.

It seems some of the problems cropped up as a result of you being one of the only remote workers as some of the negative comments came from how non remote workers assumed what it was like to work from home. You might have a different experience working on a remote only team. This forces the team to learn good remote practices that deal with these and other issues for the sake of everyone on the team.

I started working remotely as the best option at the time as well when I was looking for a switch and current remote gig showed up ticking all the boxes. I was most excited when I started and even set up at a proper office room at home. I was extremely productive and satisfied with what I was working on after several years of being passed off at my previous company. But something felt off in terms of separating work and life. I made an effort to step out every morning to get coffee, step out in the evenings to decompress. But slowly but surely it was all coming to a head, with extreme work turbulence and several management changes - 4 managers in 9-10 months. I saw my management as my link to the company as a first-time remote employee, and this was all very disorienting, and all of my life irl concentrating into the space within home. It culminated in me unable to sleep for three days straight due to work turbulence, around the same time as a loss in my family, no real friends or people I would see on a daily basis - I almost had a complete mental breakdown, and had to rush to emergency. 

While I did not miss the rotten atmosphere of my old office, all of this almost sealed the deal against my current employer (whose Glassdoor ratings have slid a solid 1 point over the past year so I know it is not entirely my incompatibility to this role but a global sentiment within the company), and in a sense also being 100% remote - or the one only remote employee in a region. Since then I have been going to a coworking space regularly just to have work outside my home. Casually running into people over lunch or coffee and sharing random jokes or conversations has been a bonus. Im not the most social person either but this experience has actually made me recognize and appreciate which elements of the social experience I do resonate with. All those events pretty much brought any plans I might have had for building a future at my current location to a screeching halt. I choose to spend time on the commute, and to allot a part of my take home to renting that space. 

All of this leads me to believe that I would like to be in an office - there are a lot of people who manage to navigate the politics and pettiness and focus on the work, it depends a lot on the mentality of the manager and people you work with. So with not much saved and the additional expense of renting coworking, and future uncertainty, I have started considering my next move. Im tired of the uncertainty and would like to, for the first time in my life, put down roots somewhere.","7"

1. What are your insurance premiums
2. How much are each of the employers putting in the HSA
3. How much are they putting in your 401k
4. How much are you spending as a result of the commute? Eating out, gas, vehicle insurance, eating out for dinner because you are too tired from the commute.

Gross salary is just that. In my opinion it is such a Trick way used to unintentionally deceive people. I recently got an offer which was supposedly $20k more but I was shocked when I did the above math that it turned out ultimately to be worth the same as my current employers. 

After getting your net salary, decide how much more money you need to make this office move worth and evaluate if it meets your need. I was in an accident earlier this year and I have never been more motivated to find a 100% remote job. But I know what net salary I will accept to make that move.

I have been working remote since a bit before the pandemic. Only change jobs when pay is clearly higher 20% or better. And keep on target to move every two years at least. This will equate to 10% or so pay increase year over year which is far better than any promotion you can get at work.

Here is where you easily recoup that so-called"" paycut.  
(Honestly, you're getting a raise)  


You no longer spend on...

1. gas.
2. Vehicle maintenance.
3. Clothes you would never buy if you didn't have to ""look acceptable""
4. Food
5. Pricey snacks.
6. Socially required entertainment (coffees, lunches, happy hours, etc.)
7. personal time regaining commute time, preparing to go to work, unwinding after commute,, chores accomplished during the workday.
8. Personal health, less stress, can be sick to a point of going to bed and still work if you feel like it.  Not getting sick from coworkers. and so many more things

There are many other benefits that we waste our personal money in order to ""get to go to"" work.  
Personally, and this is just me, I was able to put off owning more than one car in the family because I didn't need one.  
Sold mine and used public transportation or uber for personal use until a car came along I liked.  
The savings from not even OWNING that car was immense.  No payment, no insurance, no gas, no maintenance, no insurance, no licensing, no registration.....  
Yeah.  
You will likely save more than 20k.  
Monetize your sense of agency, freedom, control of your own time and  dominating the space in which you move, can make it easily worth a measly 20k","13"

Many of the points made by folks here are good to consider - as far as they go.

But realistically without knowing about what the role you have and the role you are looking at are about, I have no idea if this is a good move for you. There's no indication here where you have more room for growth salary and responsibility-wise.

Also peoples work experiences, and careers, are shaped by the managers they have. Many a job is 'good' or 'bad' based on the manger and has nothing to do with other factors. And a few years with a bad manager can slow down future progress.

I think its about habituation. When you commute to a job 30 minutes a day, youre exposed a significant portion of your life being majorly inconvenienced. You shit in a dirty, smelly work bathroom. The coffee sucks, your coworkers are annoying. Working on site also means you stop for groceries, gas, the occasional lunch out.

Work from home means you get to organize your life with less inconvenience. Youre home so you can take advantage of having stuff delivered. You can schedule outings when there is less traffic. You get the food you want prepared the way you like it. You get your own private clean bathroom.

Pretty soon being habituated to a stressful commute, traffic and crowds is replaced with being habituated to the calmness and peace of your own home  its the natural way of being. Humans werent designed for the stress of modern living.

Why *wouldnt* you naturally prefer the quiet comfort of your own home over the dirty, loud, stressful environment of urban living?

There are many proofreading/editing opportunities.

You can earn a substantial income and manage your own time. I'm a full time student and work on a part-time basis and I earn Upto $2100. This might not be a lot for some, but imagine the possibilities if you do it on a full time basis.

Here are a few companies that have proofreading opportunities, you will have to pass a language test, but I'm sure you'll ace it:
-scribbr.com
-upwork.com
-proofreadingservices.com
-scribendi.com
-fiverr.com
-proofreading.org (This is Cambridge proofreading, and by far the most difficult to get into, however, if you do it is worth it. Brush up on crossing your t's and dotting your i's, and you should be fine)

Additionally, another option to look at, which I've posted about before is Livingston-research.com, many remote opportunities available.

Last, but certainly not least, Italki, and Cambly, if you are keen on teaching English.

These platforms are all reputable. I've tried and tested them all. They work. And they can really assist you if you give it a good go.

Goodluck.","1"

That's a stupid tactic, as you have no control over who desires to work from home vs. who is willing to go into the office. Some of your best performers can and will leave over it.

The more likely outcome there is that the best performers that want to work 100% remote will end up getting some special approval to do so, which is absurd, but I guess here we are. Be thankful that there are enough companies willing to do 100% remote that instead of being screwed, it simply means that you'll have to find a new employer.

Ultimately, companies with such draconian approaches to work are going to find that they build up a reputation and over time they will eventually lose out on talent, because if a company is willing to force people to come into the office, then they'll be willing to force people to do other undesirable things as well.","2_1"

The sad reality is the kind of person who f*cks around on the clock is going to do it whether they're home or in an office. People get creative with laziness. If a company is concerned about it with remote, they can use monitoring software to measure actual productivity FFS.

Short term, it can be lonely. Long term, youre going to get *weird*. 

Heres why.

When you go to an office, you fight traffic, you talk to people you dont like, the temperature is never right, the toilet paper is thin, the bathroom smells. . . You are forced to accept and even tolerate a lot of bullshit.

When you work from home, suddenly everything is to your liking. And if you do need to go out  say to the store  you go when its less busy. Oh its raining? Youll go tomorrow. Still raining? I will get it delivered.

Once you start arranging your day like this, everything is to your liking or the bullshit gets quickly minimized. You are also  keen to not give it up. Ever.

Now you have no tolerance for bullshit. It becomes your new normal. Then you go out to lunch and start talking to people and it becomes very obvious when you talk about your life.

Ok, so now you have everything the way you want for maximum comfort and convenience, then you start questioning a lot of social bullshit. Like why you spend a bunch of money on clothes just to look fashionable. Or, why are you friends with people from
work that you dont really like? And then why is there so much social pressure to conform?

You start minimizing a lot of other bullshit in your life.

I need to be able to structure my day into distinct periods when I am interacting and periods when I am working, and when I am physically present I just can't get people to respect it.

Factory work relied upon you doing the task the same way as me. Schools were designed to reinforce that behavior. Everyone gets up at the same time, works during the day and has weekends off. You prefer art or poetry? That doesnt translate into a job so those are for *fun*.

That means your need for greater stimulation in your environment would be disruptive because no one else was doing it. But in a post-technological society, that uniformity is no longer crucial to the desired outcome. 

We seem to be moving into a world that serves neurodiversity. 

The people who hate WFH are those who need forced social interaction with strict rules of behavior like when you come in Monday morning, you talk about what you did on the weekend or sports. You and I find that boring and repetitive. Neurotypical folks find the isolation of remote work as difficult as we find the office.

Now that we are in a world that serves our needs and removes the limitations of industrial society, we dont want to go back.

Seriously, the benefits outweigh the negatives, big time.

And the disease itself can cause depression and anxiety.

Lots of research is being done but some of the likely causes are; Residual organ damage. This theory holds that the symptoms of long COVID are due to residual damage to organs caused by the bodys own immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Remaining virus. This theory suggests that after the immune system eliminates the virus, some remnants of it survive in one or more organs, and it continues to stimulate an immune response.

Exaggerated Immune response. According to this theory, in some people, COVID-19 sparks an exaggerated immune response; the immune system then remains in an overexcited state, resulting in various symptoms.

[(Yale medicine)](https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/long-covid-post-acute-sequelae-of-sars-cov-2-infection-pasc)

It causes a huge number of symptoms such as heart palpitations, tachycardia, joint pain, breathing pattern disorders, digestive problems, nausea, post exertional malaise/symptom exacerbation - (over exertion makes you worse), rash and new allergy, hormonal changes, brain fog and other cognitive difficulties, changes to vision, and lots more (these are just some of the ones Ive experienced)

Like all virus induced illness every body reacts differently, even without much thought its surely easy to understand that someone only mildly suffering from long Covid may have suffered mild damage, has smaller reserves of the virus, and/or is not susceptible to having an extreme immune response.","3_1_1_2"

Im 43, own my own company, no employees, work from my room.  Horrible resenting agony when I have to go out, see people, plan things, do a phone call, etc.

I want to let you know theres ways to make our situation work.  It takes time to build up your thing whatever that ends up being.  So just keep in mind, each day to day for you now is just about trying to do healthy things so over time, youre in a more mentally fit place, and you keep building on that.

Simple things to start trying:

Write out a daily routine or regimen. Include everything small, brushing your teeth, eating breakfast, all that stuff.  You dont have to do everything, but at the end of the day youll be able to see what you accomplished and what you need to write on tomorrows schedule.

Exercise a little.  Get 30 pushups in each day.  Go for a short walk and get some sun.  Just do anything to get your blood moving each day.

See a physiologist and physiatrist. The first one will help with talking about your current situation and provide insights as to how you look at things.  The second one might have a diagnosis for you and possibly prescribe meds to try. Some meds help some people get out of the funk.    If you cant see doctors, take omega3 fish oils til you can.

And finally:   Yes,  there are work from home employment jobs, and also you could work for yourself too.  Either way,  youre going to have to talk to people sometimes, and so its good to get your own self a bit elevated from where you are now.  Once you can handle phone calls, video calls, and back and forth emails, there are many possibilities for you.","1"

I've essentially been doing work from home, coffee shops, etc. for 20 years. And I can offer a few insights that have helped me over the years.  First: I like your focus on the tech components of a home office, including the Herman Miller.

Second, I totally agree with your ""pomodoro"" advice - to schedule both work and exercise. This is great advice for everyone, as it creates structure to an otherwise fluid day. If I want to take a break and surf the net, I make a conscious decision to exercise either before or after that 10-20 minute ""distraction"" time. For me, what works best is doing yoga AFTER surfing the net. It centers the mind, and allows me to get back to work with a positive vibe.

Third, I'll take the previous idea and add that I think a morning routine that includes exercise - even just a walk as you suggest - helps both the mind a body get in the right place for being productive. And also following lunch or dinner (if you work in the evenings)... that 5-15 minute exercise is not taking away from your work, it's making you more productive. Studies point to walking being perhaps even better for the brain than it is for the body (blood flow, etc).

So that's my quick endorsements/additions, and look forward to other people's thoughts.

EDIT: I wanted to add one additional idea: I often try to start the week (Monday or Tuesday) with an ""urgency"" day, where I try to be highly productive for an extended amount of time. Just like you would if you were headed off on vacation at midnight, you just focus as if there's deadlines looming. Makes the rest of the week flow a bit easier.","1"

Also white-collar employees will already accept a pay cut to work remote.

Another reason white-collar pay will decline is increased outsourcing.

Be able to provide concrete examples of how WFH increases productivity, happiness, work quality, etc. The more you can make it about how it benefits the company, the better. 

If WFH is as important to you as it is to me, maybe prepare nuclear options for negotiation. (Resigning, offering to drop salary by 10-20% etc.). Keep it calm and professional, with no hint of threatening and/or begging. 

No matter what you say, I don't think you'll be able to steer them that much. It ultimately comes down to a lot of factors out of your control in the short term, like how replaceable you are, budgeting, them being dinosaurs or not etc.

I tried to do this in my last job and failed. It sucks, but at least I can reassure myself with the knowledge that I'll be better off in the future with a company/position that shares my values and preferred working methods.

1. Im healthier. Im able to fit in a quick workout over lunch. Ive lost around 60-70 lbs since COVID began. This also gives me a second boost of energy in the afternoon when I used to really go into an energy slump. Besides the fact that Im much healthier and happier, my improved health metrics decrease the cost for my company to pay for my health insurance.

2. Im able to focus more and people dont interrupt me at my desk with questions that they could otherwise answer on their own if they were willing to put the work in.

3. If I need to take a break, I can step away and go get a quick chore done while I think through a problem. Before Id just go sit in a break room while the stress festered and do nothing. That compounded stress because Id sit there thinking about all the other things I still needed to get done at my house like unloading the dishwasher, doing laundry, tidying up, etc. Im less stressed now. When Im more stressed, I risk making a mistake as its difficult for me to focus. Some managers dont want to to hear the word mistake, but if you have a decent manager then they should be receptive.

First off, it's distressing to hear about these scam experiences, and I deeply empathize with anyone who's been targeted. Our site is designed to connect employers with job seekers, and it pains us to see it misused by scammers.

The nature of online job postings means that occasionally, **despite our best efforts**, scammers find ways to post fraudulent jobs. This is unfortunately a widespread issue affecting many job boards, not just GrabJobs.

Our goal is to facilitate genuine employment opportunities. We want our users to feel safe and supported. If a company asks for payment, it's definitely not legitimate. Always trust your instincts and report anything you find suspicious directly on our platform.

I want to reassure everyone that we're actively working to enhance our security measures, to block scammers, and to educate our users on identifying and avoiding scams. Your safety and trust are essential to us.

Just wanted to bring some clarifications, but please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need any support.","15"

After covid I couldn't handle it anymore, for exactly the same reasons you listed. I also felt completely unhireable for anything outside of restaurants. I read a book called What Color Is Your Parachute by Richard Nelson Bolles, and the exercises in the book really helped me figure out skills I had and environments I wanted to work in. The book is written for people trying to figure out what career path they want, those looking for a career change, and those who've been out of the work force for an extended amount of time. 

I had a little experience as a receptionist part-time at a dance studio, and so I worked to elaborate on those for my resume. I worked with a recruiter/ head hunter to find office roles. She helped me land a job as an Administrative Assistant at an accountancy firm. I did filing, organization, order office supplies, deposit checks, sent invoices, etc. I became familiar with various computer programs. I was so relieved to not have such a customer service focused job. Even a bad day there was better than being at my previous restaurant jobs lol. 

Do you have experience in anything you can play up on your resume to segway into a non-restaurant industry job? Even if it's something you did a long time ago like organizing local sports or theater, volunteer work for a charity, camp counseling, helping a friend set up their website ? I liked using a recruiter if that's something you're open to. It's free to you, and they're motivated because they get a commission once you get hired. Since I didn't have much office experience I wanted an in-person job so I could learn a lot, and now I'm looking for a remote job. 

A friend of mine left our restaurant job by taking online courses for computer programming. It was a few hard months for her, but she was able to finish it and eventually find a job. If you're open to something that requires a certification, radiologic technologists have some schooling but get paid well. Not as much money as other medical professions, but it could be something worth looking into. 

What you've learned in a restaurant is absolutely transferrable, and you're probably a better worker that most people out there! I had been wanting to get out of restaurants for so long, but it was daunting. I'm glad I did. Feeling like you're starting all over is SCARY but you have so many skills, and you will find something!","1"

Just as an example USPS is federal and you still have time to build up a full 20 year pension and retire in your late 50s. Not to mention good healthcare and a TSP match. (A TSP is the government's version of a 401k, it functions exactly the same)

Starting salaries might be comparable to what you make now, if not a bit more. Depends where you live. But I think I've read somewhere that there are opportunities for overtime as well with USPS.

As for tech, I was looking into going to a hack reactor bootcamp. For now I've decided not to because I don't need to start a new stressful career in my 30s. I have a high stress job now that mays somewhat well and I'm envious of people who are on cruise control in low stress jobs that have a good retirement set up.

My background is in network infrastructure and engineering. I've dealt with some plumbing, admittedly not on high end industrial scale but the general plumbing concepts are not difficult to understand, finding a leak in a wall might be a pain but it's not a complex or difficult concept to understand. Figuring out why your network goes down twice a week at random times and fixing it is a little more complicated than the average My toilet's water keeps running issue. 

I'm not trying to offend what you do for a living but different jobs get paid at different levels because of education and complexity.

Take chefs for example, there's actually a lot of culinary science in making a good dish but most chefs don't earn a lot of money because once you understand the basic concept it's easier to apply to other areas of the discipline. There's a reason that plumbers and chefs don't get paid as much as network engineers otherwise we'd all make the same paycheck and we wouldn't need to negotiate our salaries or anything else.

I cook, and it would be very easy for me as a network engineer to work as a chef, do I know as much as people have been through culinary school, absolutely not.

I was responsible for The content management system for a Fortune 500 company.  Had a lot of business partners that I enjoyed working with, got a lot of good work done. It felt like a fighter pilot job. I looked forward to work. My manager was extremely hands-off and I had good partners on my team. I have actually never felt that motivated before in my life.

The department had a really bad reputation before my partner and I got there (we were both hired at the same time). We restructured everything, put processes in place and made the entire team happier and more productive and we were recognized our accomplishments. 

I had some challenging weekends during that time where I really wanted the weekend to end so I could get back to my job.  Now it's a totally different picture but from what I understand the new people managing the site aren't that good at running things and don't particularly want to fix things either. And my current job is purely a compliance job that doesn't leverage any of my technical or business background. It's a kind of job you would give to an intern, but I'm still getting paid like an engineer. I'm incredibly bored and unchallenged.

I already got pulled back in on two projects because they didn't understand the network architecture issues or the compliance issues and they were out of their depth.

**Option 1:** Firing without cause. Virtually all employees in the USA are ""at will"" employees meaning that they can legally be fired at any time for any reason or for no reason at all. This is where layoffs and the like come in. You didn't do anything wrong, you're not a bad employee, they just don't want to pay you anymore.

If the employer picks option 1 they are on the hook for unemployment.

**Option 2:** Firing with cause. This is where an employer finds that an employee was grossly neglegant, didn't do their job, was driving away customers, was harassing other employees, etc. 

If an employee is fired with cause they are generally NOT eligable for unemployment. 

This is where constructive dismissal comes in. The employer wants the employee gone, but doesn't want to pay unemployment so they don't like option 1. But the employee hasn't given them any cause to dismiss using option 2.

And that's why constructive dismissial is a crime: because it's an effort by employers to avoid the legal responsibility to pay unemployment when they chose to fire someone.","1_1_1_1_2_1_2_1"

The issue is the more people you cut from the company the harder it is for the remaining ones, eventually these companies start really hurting themselves in the mid-long term for short term growth.
Once these companies max out reasonable cost cutting, they also wont realize it until 1-2 yrs later since it can take months or even 1-2 yrs before the negative impact of headcount reductions is really felt.

The other reason these companies want RTO is to fill seats for balance sheet + tax purposes.
When more people work out of a building it increases the building value on a balance sheet and also allows it to be leveraged for more money if needed.
Cities also give companies big tax breaks for bringing a lot of people into downtown areas, but only if the office buildings are well populated.

Im curious where remote work will be in 5-10 years when these companies have had the opportunity to cut their office building portfolios without doing it at rock bottom prices and when the overall jobs market is stronger.","1_1_1_3"

Point is they want people to return to the office because of one of the following reasons:
1. They hired too much, now they want to force people to leave
2. Everyone else is doing it, so it must be the right thing to do
3. Some employees actually exaggerated, creating a very bad culture where they think (and very publicly say) market is strong, they need me, so Ill do the very bare minimum and wont be going to the office anymore, and companies (rightfully) cant accept that

Go. RTO is especially damning because think of how many tax dollars could be saved by selling all of those offices in D.C.

I will say, since D.C. is sort of special with almost 2/3 of its income tax coming from gov. Workers, they are screwed. The city would take 15-20 years to recover from the state it's in now and that IF they properly pivoted their spending.","1_1_1_7_1_4_1_1"

1) Productivity has been up since covid. So this is patently false. And it's been up at Fortune 500. I've been remote for over a decade - will never work in office again. 

2) Big tech is forcing the return to work to avoid lay offs.

3) Point 2 isn't new. The pharmacy companies did that. I also know this to be the case because CFO's are closing every office they can and then talking out of the other side of their mouth on RTO. You'll see this trend reverse in a few years. BTW the big Pharma companies had multiple desks and or rotating desks, or desks in hallway to accommodate how all those closures impacted the RTO. 

4) The Canadian banks got together and announced an RTO plan all at the same time. They saw what happened in NYC and wanted to avoid that issue. 

5) It's easy enough to fire people. For non-productive work.","1_1_4_1_1_5_3"

It won't completely go away, but as far as the abundance of remote jobs, it's going to shrink drastically.

I do think some of the stuff improves over time, for example when the pandemic started and I started WFH I started realizing how terribly insulated our place was, so since then we've done several things which tremendously lowered our gas / electricity usage.  If it became the norm for people to live in well insulated dwellings with efficient multizone AC / cooling, then that plus the decreased car usage would, I imagine, push us towards a net gain.  But then as the article mentions, if WFH companies do regular get togethers that involve lots of plane flights, that alone could offset a lot of the emissions benefits.

I began working for a company who does no WFH and its my biggest gripe. At my last job I was a couple days WFH and we did everything digitally since people use laptops now and not paper.

Fast forward and now I work somewhere else who does NO WFH and the amount of paper we go through daily is INSANE. Reams and reams. My office is only 100 people. No we do not recycle or have a company who can shred our work.

The fact that the company is nationwide is a big issue too, so we do get transfers quite often and most of my coworkers are from other states or have to drive hours to get here.

Third, can I just say the heaps of stupid paper plates and cups and plastic utensils we go through daily for all the meetings and cheap overly frosted birthday cakes we need food for every week is RIDICULOUS?! At least when I worked from home I ate healthier and totally less waste since most people have washable dishes.

Shit drives me insane. Literally. Because we go through a lot of toilet paper too. I use a bidet and SOME toilet paper at home. 

Jokes aside, I really wish it were plausible to give your employees a chance to petition if they can WFH at least twice a week. My tree-hugging ass would appreciate all the unnecessary fuckin waste and plastic garbage bags being thrown out for no reason. I love the work itself, but God the company is so lazy and, dare I say trashy.","33"

Sounds ideal, right? But from an environmental standpoint, all these happy people who arent croaking as intended will lead to overpopulation and will deplete the earths resources just the same.

WFH still means higher heating and cooling costs for your whole home instead of an office space which multiple people share.

Not everyone drives to work or even drives alone. Some drive farther than others. Some take transit. Some bike or walk.

Air travel is particularly bad for the environment and carbon emissions. If your whole team works from home but fly frequently to meet up, that's not nothing.

Finally, office occupancy is something like 50% of what it was pre-COVID. Yet traffic is still just as bad. People actually drive more vehicle miles now than before. So on the whole, everyone collectively is driving more, even if some individuals are driving less to an office.","38"

American work culture and America's interpretation of Capitalism is based on control and cheap labor. I do have to laugh at all of you who think you have leverage if a company institutes RTO. You have about as much leverage as a mouse does to a cat. You are not special, you are not rare, you are not important.

When covid hit, I realized my priorities shifted. I started being able to take care of my health that had been declining over the years. I had been able to spend time with my family that I could only enjoy having their company on the weekends. My stress levels plummeted as I didnt have to spend 4 hours a day just commuting to a job in a different city. I could finally use the extra time to hone my skills and improve the quality of my work. It was the first time I actually understood how to be happy and enjoy not just my life, but my job as well. It was the first time I actually looked forward to working when I woke up. I miss that so much. I would absolutely take a lower pay if I could keep this life.","11_1"

One of my best friends works for a well known financial company. They did not allow WFH due to security concerns, although they periodically had groups of people do so as part of emergency contingency planning, and the company allowed one off approval and flexibility for things like family medical issues and snow/ice. When Covid hit, everyone became WFH, no issues, no security breaches. RTO was announced and delayed several times, now its largely based on role and work type. Tech and people who oversee large groups are full time in office, collaborative roles, those whose job involves working with other departments and a lot of meetings (my friend) are some level of hybrid, many of the lower level departments with employees who sit in a cubicle all day and dont interact with other employees are still WFH, or hybrid with more WFH days than office days. However, before Covid, the company was 100% US employees; now many of those WFH jobs are filled offshore.

Many years ago, when we were all in-office 5 days a week, a new teammate was hired and assigned a cube right outside of a VP's office. The VP did no work other than micromanaging others, and had her buddies and the yes-people she'd hired stopping by her office all day for loud, not-work-related chats with the door open. My teammate couldn't get any work done with the constant yammering happening behind his back. So he brought a mechanical keyboard in from home in the hopes that the clicking of the keys would drown out the chatting and help him focus, which it did. (I promise I'm getting to my point here) 

Couple weeks later, the VP sang praises of my teammates to our boss. ""He works so hard! I can always hear him typing on his keyboard.""

Most of the building Ive ever worked at were downtown and owned by large investors. There were also several corporations renting space inside those same buildings (eateries, other firms etc). With everyone working remotely a lot of those business did not survive and those investors had vacancy spaces. This obviously means the buildings were not as profitable. I glossed over the link you provided but it didnt seem to suggest otherwise.

I believe we are talking about different types of businesses. Im not talking small/mom-pop places in rural America. Im talking about office space in large downtown areas.","6_1_1_1"

So those small businesses folded or didn't renew their lease, leaving a vacancy. Then they jacked up the lease price... but nobody stepped up to afford the lease.  Commercial business owners then demanded tax breaks and asked cities and states to help them stop losing money. They got a little bit, but then that ran out too. So now they can either sell for a song to another wealthy person... or keep greedily demanding that other businesses force people back to work in-person, so that foot traffic maybe brings more business to the remaining businesses that are still leasing commercial space. And they are freaking out about losing future leases to businesses that have a thriving WFH workforce.


Commercial real estate is the next bubble to burst. And people who never expected to not make money hand over fist with their holdings absolutely treat it as a problem they demand to be solved. But they created a vacuum by not thinking about the future. If they had allowed small businesses to remain and given people breaks on their lease, small businesses that drove foot traffic would still be there. Cities no longer have food vendors or small shops, just large empty business buildings punctuated with the occasional homeless encampment and struggling storefronts of large businesses that don't see nearly the amount of shoppers they need to justify their lease, but are locked in for a few more years. ","6_3"

Being able to walk on the treadmill or work out during a meeting I just need to listen to.

The belief that remote workers would not work as hard as in-office workers is also exaggerated. I have had the opposite problem. It is often hard to stop working, especially because I have one role writing for my employer's clients and another doing the internal marketing copy for the business itself, so I have external clients who need stuff done on a moments notice, and internal work that needs to be completed by a specific date too.

I think it could be that people saw WFH during the pandemic and thought it would become the new normal. Unfortunately, it hasn't.

Some people want to work from home because they believe it will allow them to goof off a lot. And some people genuinely want to work, but, for various reasons, it would be much easier to do it from home. I think the people we see that are yearning for a WFH job are people who haven't yet learned that the workplace *does not care* about what's best for workers.

I have 15 years of professional work experience (communications). Went all-virtual during covid and started job hunting for a new remote job last summer. It took me 6 months of heavy applying to land a new remote gig. Submitted over 100 applications, got roughly 2-3 screeners per week, and 1-2 of those per month would have a second interview. I got deep into talks with 3 places until I finally got my offer.

Im a top performer with a strong resume, and still it was has HARD work to get the job. There arent quick fixes, no secret job boards. You have to prove yourself, and thats getting tougher and tougher to do.","6"

1. Oblivious 
no special skills or exp related to remote work but want a remote job

2. Felt entitled as freaking F
Just because they're burnt out, hate their current job, too low pay, have personal problems. Doesn't mean you're automatically entitled to a remote work by just posting in a subreddit. 

3. Delusional 
Not sure what people smoke here. But DAYUMM with a capital D. Why in the freaking why would they post that they're looking for remote work like recruiters are reading their post that don't say anything about a person at all. Like dude, if people are going to hire them for remote work, they hire through a platform that shows the candidate's capability, not through reddit that especially has anonymity.

However I believe the pros of remote work are much higher in number than the cons. Employees gain flexibility, autonomy, and are likely to be happier and therefore more productive for the business.

Your logic seems like ""well if I have to suffer, so does everyone else"". This is an unhealthy mindset and I wish you help,.

You can tell your company you are entitled to remotely work all you want, but they may not give it to you. You may look for a fully remote job, but never find one. You may want a remote job, but your job/industry isn't conducive to working remotely so you have to change careers/industries. This is why working remotely is entitled. 

Also, not everyone thrives working remotely and for some it actually causes more harm to their mental wellbeing and lifestyle, just like working in an office might cause you more harm. 

Lastly, not that it really matters, but I'm 100% remote and will never need to back into the office at my current job and from what I can see, probably never in my career.

This slowly but surely resentment towards hard work makes me want to work remote where I can finally sit down, enjoy watching my kids grow up, and still stay dedicated to my employer.

I always thought a major part of RTO was to do soft layoffs. What my company did was have people RTO 3x a week if they were on a written or above for corrective action.

Where it gets interesting is that when they implemented this policy, they also changed how handling accounts were being graded by QA. It became alot easier for people to get on a written, myself included for the first time. They thought people wouldn't notice I guess but I dodged it myself by using my vacation time until the written expired but told my TM the next time this happened I would just refuse on principle alone because they couldn't give us a valid reason why they made this policy other than ""collaboration"" lol. 

Also interesting that makes me believe this theory even more is they only had this policy for like a couple departments, which tells me it was only for departments they had to trim the fat so to speak. Well the office is nearly empty when I do go in once a week as compared to how we used to have two buildings full now only one and its almost empty 

For reference I work for a big bank. So to drive the point home, I guess their way of getting rid of the more undesirables compared to the better workers so to speak was by using the new corrective action policy.","1_1_3"

In some cases at least on paper they are preparing to hire a good bit of what they let go, so maybe it is less of a downsize and as much of a sifting excercise to weed out the less loyal or in your case less stringent maybe?

Amazon for example. Several of their regional HQs were heavily subsidized by local cities through tax breaks, under the promise that the offices would bring with them high-income foot traffic for local businesses.

So what if businesses go under? New ones will be established to serve the remote worker. Its not like that money wont be spent, it will just be spent differently.

Also, cities want you to spend more money in them. Not elsewhere. People don't (largely) live in Manhattan, they just work there. So you need workers to sustain the economy.

The same is true for most downtown areas, it's primarily commercial real estate. Most cities have seen their residential populations decline while simultaneously their working populations increase over the past 50 years.

If you think Amazon is building massive warehouses in downtown areas, I dont think you understand their potential infrastructure needs such as electrical, loading docks, or the parking required for 1,000 workers. Can you imagine all the Amazon trucks clogging downtown streets? The transportation needs alone warrant being on a major thoroughfare  even a railroad siding.

I honestly think you dont have a good grasp on this subject. Outside of Chicago, LA, or San Francisco, there are very few areas in the US that are similar to Manhattan. That is not a typical situation at all.

City zoning would not locate a warehouse in the financial district nor would the company want to be somewhere with shitty parking. The city isnt going to cut a sweetheart deal for prime real estate because incentives wouldnt be needed. These are strategic moves to expand the community in a direction the city wants, not to concentrate more traffic in the downtown area. The city will have to provide water, sewer, electrical and roads to accommodate the facility, it wants them where it makes the most sense for the citys urban planning.

I was never given any guidance, but a lot of this was my own fault (came in to a big org in an aqcquisition - I was too immature for the level of position I had and/or aspired to).

Having said that - nobody, and I really mean it, nobody that ever worked for me came out worse because of it.  Everybody advanced in the direction they wanted, everybody learned a bunch.  I took great pride in really caring about that.

I just wasn't very good at the management bit, particularly dealing with turf-related things and cross-org communication.

My philosophy was ""I don't give a shit when, how, or where you do your work. I give a shit that it gets done.  If I feel like you can be doing a lot more and you're sandbagging, I'm going to be disappointed, and we're going to have words. ""   

I think it's that last big that drives a lot of the RTO - this fear that ""the team could be doing more and they aren't.""  Well, sure, maybe.  

Many managers suck at building requirements, scoping projects, and forming SMART goals.  Thus, they feel that they can somehow make up for this by ""watching"" people work.

Fuck that.  I will know if you aren't working to your potential - because I know my team.  That doesn't mean constant 80 hour weeks.  It just means that if you're way below, I want to know why and if we need to account for it, and how we get you back up there.","2_1_1_1"

How long do you document someone being ""absent/under performing"" before HR lets you take action?

How much interaction is required with HR to perform said action that isn't a standardized PIP that gives them 90 days to improve - where they will be job hunting anyway.

How long does it take to refill the position, even remote positions are not immediately filled

Who's going to take over the workload? You? LMFAO. Now you have an additional disgruntled employee who's taking up the responsibility with no pay increase - HR blocks it saying the position will open shortly

All that to avoid paying out unemployment btw because you couldn't adequately prove the employee was shit based on government's opinion - even after months of docing everything.

Let me put it in a way that people read this will understand, when playing a video game there are two very distinct meta categories - skill level and Comfort/effectiveness. If I spend all day hitting AOEing an area with 3 keys movements and am 1-2% slower than the guy who is playing the game like a DDR pad to get 1% more - people are going to gravitate to the lesser.

You know why they gravitate that way even though it's slightly less efficient? Because effort, which as above, disciplining an employee has multiple facades of consequences that affect all chains.

So rather than optimizing your team, you do a blanket withdrawal of the thing that pulls more effort out of you, you can reinstitute it later. That's the mentality of leadership making the decisions - there's a common problem, quickly chop off the part that is enabling them being ineffective.","44_1_1_2_1"

The basic finding was that in aggregate the move to remote work caused a small bit statistically significant improvement in productivity. 


However if you break the data down by industry it's not uniform. A lot of industries saw reduced productivity from remote work to offset the ones that saw higher productivity. I found the list to be intuitive mostly (information services saw high gains) but also unintuitive in other areas (funds/trusts and other financial vehicles saw gains, but securities firms and insurance services saw reduced productivity). Mining saw large gains but oil and gas extraction saw large losses.

To your point about collaboration - totally agree that written communication improves clarity. But sometimes, a 30-second video update can convey so much more than a wall of text. Thats the gap I was trying to fill.

IT consulting for clients around the world.  Out of 790 employees, only 37 are WFH and that number is expecting to drop to less than 20 next year.

Reason why is our WFM is low, our hybrid workforce loses a bit of synergy when remote.  Average employee, will be engaged with 15~20 projects/clients each month.  Not unusual to go about our office and pull someone into the project for a few hours.  Much easier to do this in person.  

Employees that are WFH miss out on this.  It just works for our company.  Employees do have option to WFH.  But most want hybrid and possible travel.  Company does give more benefits and bonuses for Hybrid.  Company comp for vehicle-transit-childcare-brings in breakfast/lunch.  

By being in office, one can be easily brought into another project.  Every project can bring in bonuses.  Not unusual to see a hybrid worker get a $40k-$75k quarterly bonus, if they grind out hours for twenty or more projects each month. 

So this works for my workplace.  Majority of workers want to stay hybrid, at least 3 days a week.  They are seen by those that pull in resources for our client projects.  Hybrid workers can travel to engage with clients directly and in person, which our clients prefer.  

WFH-Video only workers miss out on in person interactions, reading the clients, and personal details.  Our clients say this to my company.  Reason why our company is picked, can be our work is fast paced, ability to make decisions within an hour instead of checking calendars to set a virtual meeting and able to be direct with in person contact.

As someone who's never worked in consulting, I found your approach incredibly interesting, especially how you've tied compensation to engagement - it's a brilliant way to ensure measurable outcomes.



I'm curious though - with 790 employees, are your offices divided into different floors or rooms? I ask because I once worked in a multi-floor office where communicating via internal phones wasn't much different from remote communication. 



The virtual office technology has evolved dramatically. Tools now allow us to instantly grasp who's available, ""overhear"" relevant conversations, and join discussions naturally - sometimes with even less friction than walking between physical office spaces. It's fascinating how these tools are eliminating physical constraints while maintaining the spontaneous interactions you value.



Here's what I'd love to hear your thoughts on: If the technology evolved to where your current work style could be fully replicated online, do you think it would enhance your team's life quality? Or is there something irreplaceable about physical presence in consulting work?



I've personally enjoyed both in-person and remote work immensely, so I'm genuinely curious about your perspective, especially given your extensive experience in high-intensity consulting environments!","75_1"

We typically see 450-500 are traveling per week.  Rest are working at one of our offices in US.  Have 13 offices.  Largest is HQ in Austin, but only has about space for 300-350 workers.  It is a two story building, with open collaboration areas.  A few offices, C Suite-Directors.  But as a Director level employee, I actually still work on projects.  So I will be on floor or conference-work rooms all the time.  

So our hybrid workers are broken into teams, just for a start based on their skill and knowledge. We freely encourage our workers to learn new skills-provide training and send to training workshops.  Team leads will seek out our Project leads, to align workers for what each project needs.  As projects progress, workers can be replaced, added, dropped as workflow changes.  Teams are just a location category.  So a worker can be designing a private cloud solution for South Korean client one morning, move to AWS migration for client in California that afternoon, to working 8-12 other clients rest of the week.  

It can be hectic at times.  But we have a small core group of resource specialists.  They make sure employee fits for our client needs.  Because we can organically add the right specialist, projects tend to finish early, earning huge bonuses.  

Since there is not a need to carry 40 hr a week for an employee on the project, dead time is eliminated from the project.  Which leads to additional bonus from clients.  

We call this right sizing worker engagements.  Not many consulting companies do this, rather bloated projects and extend.  We want fast and agile.  Saving clients time and money.  Ultimately the client will pay us for 8 months of work plus bonus, what other vendors say will take 18-24 months, lol.  One reason why we are booked 12-18 months out&

Now as for in person and why we prefer this type of work environment?  You see we can cut a 18-24 month project to 8 months.  Because we love todo drive by engagements.  We have a quick question that needs 15 min of clients time.  Easier to just walk to that client employee, find other needed client personal, and ask the question to get a quick answer.  That 15 min walk up meeting in a break room at noon?  Just saved 2-4 weeks of scheduled meetings to get the same answer.  

As for online replacing our workflow?  No, not easy to be able to grab a quick impromptu meeting online.  Everyone says it can be done.  But in my 28 years of consulting, hasnt been able to do as easily via virtual meetings.  

Sorry, cant tell you the time savings I did today alone, just by walking my office floor for 1 hour, saved at least 7 projects 2-4 weeks of waiting for a damn simple answer.  Seriously, I walk the floors today, asked questions.  Found I could cut through tape-delays of virtual meetings.  It is that simple sometimes.  Virtual full time causes disconnects.  Sure you see everyone, but they are online. Much easier to read the situation, when you see 2-5 people huddling over something walking around the office.

Heck, helped a project lead as I heard her complain in break room.  Something you will never get virtually.  Probably only saved a week to 10 days.  But I would imagine client will be happy over 11 employers not waiting at a potential 8 hrs a day of waiting.  

As for high level consulting?  It can be at times.  Working on finalized design for EU third largest bank, pulling from Azure/AWS to private cloud solution to helping fix a lingering CrowdStrike issue for client in Australia then moved on to a security issue for large global manufacture to a simple Exchange migration plan for a state government in US.  Thats today.  But love working for different clients and tackling new issues.  I would get bored with standard daily operations.  Would quit after a week, lol&","75_1_1"

About a 6% turnover per year.  Not due to hating the work, but most due to their family changing or personal issues not related to our company per exit reviews.  Most we think get poached by larger consulting firms, but no hard data to confirm.

Now one thing we do alot of internships.  With focus on local high schools where are offices are located.  So we will see 60-80 summer interns at our largest office/HQ. Most spend 2-3 summers at our company.  We typically send offer letters, we tend to get most of our new hires via that stream.  We worked with them in a mentoring capacity.  We will offer them training to catch up on certs.  And do offer college assistance, but degrees are not required for majority of our consulting roles.

Are you mid-management who is honestly expressing that the workers in the company actually like the hybrid policy? I daresay, without knowing your company, your hybrid work policy is a mandate people will deal with because, as you mentioned, your company is 'upfront about travel and hybrid'.  Right...so folks will go to your interview, and they are chosen knowing this.  It's clear from all the reporting, surveys and analyses of the modern work environment available in the world, that nearly all workers who do desk jockey jobs (not bloody sales jobs where they have to sit in a plane to sell stuff for the company) do not want to go into the office.  It's clear that there is no negative change in profitability of companies who mandated workers to WFH during the lockdowns.  None.  They all made money and workers are annoyed that all of a sudden, companies who are mandating RTO cite whatever kind of rubbish metrics to proclaim that RTO would be better FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED, including the workers who are burdened with commute time, additional expenses beyond what their wages can and should cover, the needless amount of time wasted sitting in cubes pretending to look busy and most of all, overbearing, nitpicky middle managers who excel at distracting employees as they quietly do their work.

What's the name of the company, mate?  Show us all the metrics that support a BETTER company strategy in support of hybrid schedules that diminishes exclusively work from home policy.  As I mentioned, include profitability and worker satisfaction with the hybrid policy.  I've been on reddit long enough to be sceptical of these claims.   Frankly, your post seems a bit cryptic if not overblown in support of the hybrid model.   WFH is the future and companies really should give it a rest.  If you need employees to be onsite, then so be it but do not entice applicants to apply with promise of WFH model only to reverse it soon after hire.  Hybrid doesn't even enter an applicant's mind if they have worked at 100% remote.","75_2_1_1"

You're absolutely right - our company's success is nowhere near OpenAI or Anthropic's level. And I agree that different industries and company stages might require different approaches. The AI industry's rapid innovation and competitive landscape definitely presents unique challenges.

However, I think this highlights an interesting nuance in the remote work discussion. While top-tier AI companies and FAANG might benefit from in-person collaboration due to their specific needs (rapid iteration, complex collaboration, breakthrough innovation), this doesn't necessarily invalidate remote work for companies with different goals and contexts.

My perspective comes from running product companies where deep, focused work and global talent access are more crucial than rapid in-person iteration. We're not competing in the AI arms race - our success metrics are different.

I'm particularly intrigued by your personal situation - choosing between the lifestyle benefits of remote work and career growth opportunities in SF. It's a real dilemma that many in tech face. Do you think this dynamic might change as more companies find ways to balance high-performance collaboration with flexible work arrangements? Or is the in-person advantage simply too fundamental for cutting-edge innovation?","81_2"

Every permutation between fully in office and fully remote has been tried, whether distributed or not. There's a reason all the top firms converged on the same work model.

Others can try to not do so, they just can't compete and die.

The flexible work arrangement is 3-4 days in office instead of 5. Some companies do a few weeks of remote week per year - eg. go take four weeks to work in Santorini but come back to the officer after.","81_2_1"

I mean many of the most profitable companies by their nature could not be characterized as being 'in office' in the firstplace- all the Oil &amp; Gas companies, all of Pharma, Walmart, Home Depot, even Amazon, packages deliveries aren't an in office job.

I'd like to see a break out of profit by unit within these companies, to see what the units contributing the most profit were possible via remote in the first place.

I think you'd need to have a little data to support the 'best paying' point as well. For example large crane operators make great pay - some up to $250K a year, but that clearly isn't an in office job.

One of the core user insights we discovered was that many managers weren't actually concerned about productivity - they wanted the ""feeling of seeing people work."" This emotional need for visual reassurance was consistently more powerful than actual performance metrics.

This really struck me as a peculiar human trait. It's not about whether people are working, but whether they ""appear"" to be working. While I understand this is a very human desire, it feels at odds with modern work principles.

It reminds me of the old ""factory floor"" management mentality, where supervisors could physically see workers on the production line. But knowledge work is fundamentally different - someone staring intently at their screen might be deeply focused or just scrolling social media. Physical presence tells us surprisingly little about actual productivity.

This insight has made me wonder: Are we holding onto outdated management practices because they provide emotional comfort, rather than because they're effective? Perhaps the real challenge in remote work adoption isn't the technology or productivity - it's helping managers develop new ways to feel confident about their team's engagement without relying on visual cues.

100% this. I knew about a manager saying that he was enforcing RTO because he ""likes to see people"". Obviously he did not write that down to justify RTO. Just imagine a grown man admiting on writing that he is putting his feelings above objective standards and making dozens of people on his team miserable because of that.

I feel it's a bit ignorant to say it's only about control. I think the reason varies drastically, but some companies have definitely seen a drop in productivity. Certain things are just more efficient face to face. Like meetings, which makes up a big portion of people's day.

What works for one company might not for another. 

I say this, hating to commute and paying high rents as much as the next guy.

I really like the hybrid approach. Almost the entire team is in the office 2 days a week and we focus on having meetings and ad hoc conversations. It's also great for building a team culture. It's extremely hard to build that remotely (I'll die on this hill). 

The rest of the week we can focus on other stuff. But we still have meetings over zoom.

I recently changed from a position where my entire team was remote and I don't miss that one bit. The main benefits of remote to me is not having to commute. However, if you have kids things change quite a lot. Especially in the US where there are so many activities you have to drive them to.","83"

That does not mean all meetings are efficient IRL or otherwise.

Other jobs are not like this. They watch you like a hawk, moreso than if you were working on site. You have no down time, every thing you do from a 15min break to calling a manager to sending an email, must be logged. Its maniacal. Even though youre working from home, you feel no peace.

*""They do want training, but I think a lot of them want free time, or the illusion of free time, sitting at home, where you dont have corporate protocols and procedures.""*

There's no *illusion* of free time. There is only actual free time. Not spending 2.5 hours in traffic is not an illusion. Being able to start dinner at 5 instead of 6:30 is not an illusion. Being able to see your kids in the morning is not an illusion.  Being able to balance work and life is not an illusion. AbovetheLaw is quoting a managing director, not an associate.

**Roadmap also wrong:**

*""From a younger employees perspective, work from home often means you get to sit in your studio apartment in front of your laptop, and good luckyoure cut off from everything else, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen said last year at the American Dynamism Summit, warning that remote work has detonated the way we connect as a society.*

Young employees at my company need to be in the office maybe 4-5 days a week only for *initial training and orientations*. That is valuable. Offering some social events during work hours (compensated) also benefits new or remote employees who thrive in social settings. But feedback I've received from GenY staff is that they too hate the commute costs, fake ""culture"" and tiny open cubes.  Marc Andreessen is not a younger employee. He's not GenZ. He's not working class. He's not middle class.  He doesn't have to take public transportation or sit in a Covid/flu/RSV-superspreading cube farm. Want an opinion from GenY, ask them.

 He also comments why associates *perceived* a negative culture shift at their firms. No, dipshit, they didnt perceive, they *experienced* a negative shift. That is like telling women in childbirth that they  *perceived* pain. Or telling minimum wage workers that they *perceive* lack of rent funds.

Associates work long hours, often way over 50 hours a week, especially when they are new. Going from an environment where they were trusted and offered some flexibility to manage a heavy workload to being forced to come in 3+ fixed days a week in so some power hungry micromanaging partner can take morning attendance before she/he checks out for the day is indeed a negative shift. They do benefit from mentorship, of course, but there is no reason for them to be in the office on a strict schedule. The only reason to force them into the office early and have them leave at 8 is to crush their personal life &amp; assert dominance.

We did ours about 5 or so years ago, not too long after we built the house, so I honestly don't recall what they were running before we did them. We installed 22 panels, and at the time, I wanted to add more. My solar guy (who I've known from before), said the issue for me was getting them approved. He said they won't approve a system that will produce more than 100% of what we are currently using. I didn't have the EVs back then but I knew I was going to get one.

So at first, my bill was pretty much nothing, as those 22 pushed it to pretty much cover 100% of it. Once I got the first and then eventually second EV, I know I need to add more, but it's one of those things that I just haven't done yet. Then another thing we did, adding even more to our usage, we put in a built in pool this past year. That pump running adds a little more to it, but it's not that big of a deal.

So right now, my electric runs about an average of $150/month depending on how much we drive.  Oh, as for the price, I paid 22k for the system. They had a deal where I got zero interest on it at first, but then I got lucky and refinanced my mortgage a few years ago, before the rates went up, and rolled that into it. So you could say I'm paying for it over the course of the next 30 years but I don't look at it that way. We will eventually downsize before then and I'll just pay that off then. 

For you it might not make sense, but for us it did. Plus, even if it's not the best financial move, I like being part of the solution there are also other things to consider, like if you have a good spot for them. The angle of our roof is not bad, but if we were facing 90 degrees the one way, it would probably be a tiny bit better.","14_2_2_1"

Yeah, just dont see additional gain for adding solar.  Maybe if electric rates are 2x.  But pretty stable what with utility is a CoOp and gets almost half power from renewables already, Hydro and some Solar/Wind.  


Question about our electricity bill?  What are your minimum rates?  Every utility has a minimum rate per month.  I have no idea if $48 is expensive or cheap, my downtown 4k sq ft condo minimum rate charges $65 plus electricity used.
ROI is still fickle with what savings of only $100-$125 per month, minimum bill will always be at least $48 unless CoOp adds more Solar/Wind.  

House does not need a lot of AC or Heating, so little power usage.  Just Fridge and HotTub being largest power uses.  House rebuilt in 2018, so very efficient for insulation.  Have backup power already setup.","14_2_2_1_1"

If you have well defined tasks and expectations, you might be able to make that claim, but as a CEO your role is much more nebulous. It's all strategy and direction; there will always be more to do, more things you can get more understanding of. So who is telling the CEO to spend 60+ hours on it? Themselves. At 60, is all the work done? No. If they cut it off at 40, is anyone going to say they're slacking, they missed something? No. It's all on themselves. 

Which, to your point, is not purely a CEO trait; I've seen ICs, managers, directors, and VPs all fall in the same trap, working way more hours than they need to, and in fact way more hours than they're productive. But, that's kind of my point; the types of people who behave this way will naturally gravitate towards roles that are performative in nature, and CEO very much is a performative role (that's not saying there's nothing real there, just, the optics matter as much as anything else; stock prices rise and fall based on optics as much as anything financial). And so just because they're working 60 hours a week doesn't mean they're actually doing real work (every study done on knowledge workers would say they're actually less useful doing that), and it also shows why they would be inclined towards a performative element in their workforce, namely, people sitting in offices.","2_1_3_1_1_1"

Again, the research is unanimous here, knowledge workers are not productive more than 40 hours a week over long periods (actually, lower than that; the sweet spot seems to be about 30, though there's some individual variance. 40 was based on physical labor; the same trend applies there).","2_1_3_1_1_1_2_1_1_1"

Also, I've speculated it has to do with work place device installed worker productivity software. If they want to look at the software and use it which a lot of companies do in order to monitor levels of productivity the different parameters that generate productivity time have numbers attached to them. 

Many managers must also realize that on their own work issued devices the software also exists. 

Now suppose I'm on site and I'm a manager in my office and five different people need to talk to me they're going to have to come up to my office one by one... ""Hi how are you?"" there's going to be some small talk right? Each person I talk to it takes about 10 minutes then I've been productive for the course of an hour..
Now suppose I'm at home and the same five different people ask their question to me over teams or email? I will probably be able to respond to all of them in half that amount of time that it would have taken in person... But my computer is monitoring my productivity time now. So when managers work remotely it looks like they're doing LESS work. The workplace productivity software will see that they responded to all these questions in half the time it took them to do it on site. I think this is actually where productivity paranoia stems from. The managers aren't paranoid that their workers aren't being productive enough. The managers are paranoid that they themselves are not producing productivity numbers that are high enough. They are being judged through the same lens that they're using to judge their employees and they might realize uh-oh when it comes time for layoffs, management is going to have the lowest productivity metrics.","8_2"

Went there at home they can't do this and they realize that their jobs maybe aren't as important as they thought. Especially when they start to hear all the data coming out saying that remote working makes employees more productive. What's next after that? Of course they would be in a hurry to return to work. If companies stayed remote then management and leadership would be determined by the software to have the lowest metrics of productivity.

So even a pro RTO asshole admits the studies don't show any NEGATIVE impact on productivity. Doesn't that put the lie to the whole C&amp;C horseshit they keep feeding us? If it doesn't hurt and may slightly help the company, and DRAMATICALLY helps the employees, the only reason not to continue it is a psychopathic desire to not help employees.   

&gt; Almost five years since the start of the pandemic, many C.E.O.s are ready to move on from an experiment they never wanted to start.   

While I have no doubt it applies to some, maybe many, it doesn't address why the not-insignificant number of companies who were not forced into WFH, who had it for years (sometimes more than ten years) before COVID, suddenly want RTO.

Arthur C. Clarke

Remote and fully flexible work is no longer a question of debate. Whether CEOs and executives agree or not, the reality is clear: remote work is here to stay. It has already transformed how we live and work, making us healthier, happier, more productive, and delivering undeniable benefits for the environment. A new way of living has been firmly established, and there is no turning back.

Working in an office feels as outdated as sending letters in an age of email. Remote work saves time, money, and resources, enabling employees and companies alike to thrive. Companies that embrace remote work and full flexibility are already reaping the rewards. These forward-thinking organizations are attracting top talent and reducing turnover. Most skilled professionals will eventually gravitate toward these companies, leaving traditional workplaces struggling to compete.

The environmental impact of remote work is equally transformative. Reduced commuting means fewer cars on the road, lowering greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. This shift contributes to a more sustainable future, aligning businesses with the global push for environmental responsibility.

The evidence is overwhelming: remote work increases productivity, supports mental and physical well-being, and allows employees to design a life that balances career ambitions with personal fulfillment. It empowers individuals to work from anywhere, embracing a global talent pool and breaking down geographic barriers.

The new normal of work is not a temporary trend but a fundamental evolution. Companies that resist this change risk falling behind, while those that adapt will lead the way into a more sustainable, equitable, and innovative future.

Long live remote work. The future has arrived, and it is flexible, inclusive, and unstoppable.","67"

You get that flexibility in your life for health but you get to maintain stronger connections and more fruitful collaboration on-demand. The problem with a 3-day hybrid is that too many people abuse it and come in only 1-2 times/week which has led to this 5-day mandate.","68"

Vacation depends on the company. Some companies everyone gets the same regardless of time there. Some take your experience with other companies in account when determining how much you get.","1_2_3_2_1"

Pension: Who has a pension these days? The likelihood of OP having one isn't huge, but I suppose it's possible. Salary and benefits negotiation is part of the interview and hiring process, so if new company doesn't offer a pension, OP could try to negotiate a different benefit or a specific salary bump.

Vested retirement: 401k can be converted to a Roth IRA, for example. There are other options as well. I'm not sure what you mean by vested retirement not being able to be matched at a new company, vested retirement is vested and therefore belongs to OP.

Accrued vacation might be paid out when leaving, might not be, so yeah, that could be a bummer. If you're referring to someone having gotten bumps in PTO as they advanced at their company, then PTO can be negotiated as part of the compensation discussion with a new company.","1_2_3_2_2"

&gt; Tim Gurner, an Australian real estate titan and multimillionaire, made international news last week by being recklessly honest about his desire for unemployment to spike and regular workers to suffer...

&gt; What truly deserves attention is why Gurner feels the way he does -- and how its precisely explained in an essay written in 1943, titled Political Aspects of Full Employment.

&gt; In it, Polish economist Michal Kalecki argued that government spending could ensure a permanent economic boom with both low unemployment and increased business profits. Crucially, however, Kalecki predicted that business executives would *hate* having what everyone else sees as a good economy, because it would allow regular people to be less subservient to them. For the business class, no amount of money can replace the daily joy of watching your inferiors grovel when in your presence....","2_1_5"

You can do it. Meanwhile you can just put in the basic level of effort at your current job and don't bring up the relocation anymore. Otherwise you are at risk of being let go before you are ready.


The alternative is to stay where you are at the expense of what's best for your personal life, and you're likely to be resentful to your current company, too.

I'm in a similar situation: WFH for 10 goddam years (along with ~25-33% of my 60K fellow employees). This year, out of the blue, they instituted RTO (hybrid, 3 days in office). Why? ""Culture and collaboration"", which even single-celled organisms floating in the ocean know is total horse shit.

The possible entity(ies) applying the pressure and their motivation(s) are varied, depending on who you talk to (my best guess is that it's CRE-related). But for companies SUCCESSFULLY using remote work for LONG before COVID to suddenly reverse course makes no sense OTHER than the aforementioned pressure.  

**Possible** caveat for your relo rejection: Could it be a ""state"" thing? Not every company is set up to have employees in ever state.

No. Just the aforementioned ""culture and collaboration"" crapola. And given the amount of times (small sample size alert) I see that mentioned here as the reason other companies are giving, it's like they're all operating from the same play book. Almost like whoever is applying the ""pressure"" I mentioned also said ""and you can sell RTO to your employees by stressing the culture and collaboration aspects of in-office work"".   

&gt; This part doesnt make sense.   

No shit.   

&gt; I believe it cost more money for the company if employees have to work in the office like (infrastructure, etc&..)  

Of course it does. And given that the general attitude of most companies today (well ... forever, I guess) is ""I'd fuck my grandmother's corpse for an additional $1 in profit"", the fact that they're PURPOSELY foregoing these savings and/or incurring additional costs(\*) further backs up the ""mystery power in the shadows coercing RTO"" theory.  

\* - My company is actually expending MORE money (above and beyond rent, etc.) in getting the targeted RTO spaces ""up to snuff"" (new chairs, monitors, laptops, etc.). It's insane.  


&gt; Im amazed there has been work from home employees 10 years ago. It goes to show we already have the technology available a long time ago to allow work from home.  

Absolutely. And it further proves that it can be done with AT WORST no reduction in productivity (or we'd have heard about the dozens and dozens of studies showing that), and more likely with somewhat INCREASED productivity. So, companies are willingly spending MORE MONEY to get LESS OUTPUT. Topsy-fucking-turvy, man.","5_2_1"

Personally, I think there is something to it, in that I have no doubt some companies are utilizing RTO for that reason. But I by no means think it's the main driver. For one thing, there's not enough ""control"". You can't control who gets cut. For some roles, that's more important than for others (and your ""best people"" are more likely to leave first as they'll be more in demand, leaving you with a higher percentage of dead weight).  Also you can't control when they leave. If you need to trim payroll by a give deadline, implementing RTO may get rid of a few people ahead of forced layoffs, but likely not enough to avoid having to do forced layoffs anyway.  Also also, once you've reached the desired staffing level, then what? Do you suddenly say ""hey, guess what? you can all WFH again! Hooray!!!"" If you don't, you might well continue to lose people. 

So at the end of the day I think there are some companies who are using RTO for that purpose, and either they don't care about the things I mentioned or they haven't considered them. But, again IMO, the whole RTO push just ""feels"" too coordinated for that to be a major factor.","5_2_1_1_1"

I do not know where you are trying to relocate to but there are programs existing now where certain States are actually paying for people to relocate to their state and take up residence and employment. They offer cash bonuses, in  some cases, and assistance with finding employment as well as housing. They are particularly looking for people who are above the $70,000 annual pay rate and are also family oriented. It may be well worth your time to investigate this option.

For example, I live in Oklahoma and this is the offer they present;

1. Tulsa, Oklahoma. Since 2018, Tulsa Remote has provided remote employees who relocate to this US city in the center with a $10,000 incentive. The organization aspires to expand its community to 4,000 members by 2027 and has an incredible $307 million in direct job income.

They can have whatever policies on relocation they want. Failing to comply with the policy would be grounds for termination with cause. Especially since you have it in writing that your request has been denied. 

My last company required me to be both within 50 miles of an office and 60 miles from a major airport. My role was 100% travel. 

My current role is 100% remote / WFH. Zero office requirement. Even with that, my telework conditions require that I get written permission to work anywhere else if its going to be for more than 2 weeks. 

Unless youre an independent contractor you have to follow the rules. People saying they cant stop you from moving are only partially right. They can fire you or consider it job abandonment, insubordination, or a variety of other things. 

They can also allow it and adjust your salary down based on the areas COL.","55"

It's okay because other people in the company are complaining about hybrid, threatening the company if they can't work remote, and because they are paying you.

Its a big story still right now. Your version matches other types of moves in the past where companies use this strategy since theyre counting on people who cant make the move to resign and lower their staff count. Its a tactic to reduce numbers before having to resort to layoffs. The fact they arent working with you as a long-tenured employee lends weight to that being their reasoning. If they were doing fine as a company and prized experienced employees, they would flex on it for you.

So, your story is a good one to kick off a bigger article with and there business reporters out there who would be interested. Caring for an aging parent adds a lot to the hook as it ties into other big issue problems coming down the pipes in the economy right now as well. Your experience relates to a lot of people. HARO might be an option for identifying reporters, but if you can find someone from a newspaper near you who writes about the topic or business in general, you can drop your account into their tip line link. Its been a while since Ive done reporting, but have seen times where a company getting put on the spot publicly does shift and make an exception for the person mentioned in the story.

I think its worth a shot since I think others are right that youre going to have to look for a new job otherwise.

I quit and seek new employment, pls give good reference! 

Being that I was (and am) in good standing, they said ""absolutely not, we will make it work, don't quit."" 

Sometimes it's better to just do it and ask permission, other times it's better to be upfront, other times still it is ok to be up front with a hint of a white lie.

This is the biggest issue right here.  People are not smart with money.  Many have no support system.  To be able to push employers to get WFH across the board for every job that qualifies for it, that would require all the things you mentioned.  Many Americans don't have those things.

Now, I will also say that if you have skills that are in short supply, its a lot easier to get remote work because replacing you with someone else is incredibly hard.

It's a problem for them because people are happy, there are multiple studies and articles about the benefits of working from home.

People and companies hire on their terms but based on the market. If they pay enough and provide something better than other companies, they can mandate an in-office presence as part of the conditions.

However, if there is competition in that particular field and available WFH opportunities exist(like in IT, for example), they may struggle to fill that position and decide the work can just as easily be done at home and create remote opportunities. 

In addition, there are external conditions such as a company getting tax breaks for providing jobs and a tax base in a certain area and that influences the decision. 

Last of all, companies are influenced by previous experiences such as workers doing well at home in a particular field vs workers that dont do anything and others have to cover for them. Some jobs fit better and certain levels of workers perform better in that situation. 

But companies do not allow work from home because its a  right.  Thank you for providing these opportunities if you are actually an employer.

If your requirement is to work from home, you can decide if working from a home is a condition which you require in order to accept a position, and the company has to decide if working from home is acceptable for the position they are hiring for. When you work for someone, you are entering into a voluntary agreement with them on the mutual conditions of your employment. If you situation changes, or you just decide to change your mind, you can quit at any time. If the company's situation changes, they can lay you off any time. There are no guarantees. No one can force you to marry them. No one can force you to work for them. You can't force them to accept your conditions.  There is nothing here that has anything to do with Ego. 

That is...until you imply that anyone owes you anything other than what they have agreed to owe you. If you were promised the ability to work from home and then the company went back on it, then I'd understand that your upset. But, to imply that anyone has any right to anything in this question IS in fact the highest level of ego here. A right assumes that it's a fundamental thing that no one should be able to deny you. You don't have the right to compel  any individual or company to force them to let you work for them under your conditions. Neither does the company have any right to compel you to continue working for them. There are ZERO rights in play here. Your only right is to walk away, and the company has every right to tell you to F off. 

By the way. I 100% work from home. But it's because I found a position with a company that allows it. It's not a right. Your statements are completely absurd. 

If you don't want to get up, 5 days a week and fit their schedule, and work for the company goals, then don't work for the company. Because that's literally why they hire you. If you want to work towards your own goals, then create your own company.

Let's tell the truth here, this discussion you present would have been considered completely absurd until the happenings of last 3 years or so. Companies under pressure from local and Federal governments were basically forced to send people home. You better  work yourself way higher up the chain of command before you start trying to say employees should have the right to choose where they work??? Do your fellow firefighters, police office, fast food workers, garbage collectors etc. give up their right to work where they feel like it, or is they actually a purpose for having order in this world and putting people where (as compensated employees) the employer certainly has some right to tell you how they would like you to do this job for them. You can speak for yourself regarding a job just being something you have to do to survive. Believe or not they are many, many people that enjoy and take pride in the jobs they have. Jobs are social beings, they create friendships, trust, annoyances, competition. They expand your brainpower, they help people socialize, avoid mental illness, loneliness.. Jobs are good for your wellbeing yet you act like they are an inconvenient part of our daily lives. WFH for the masses was a BLIP on the radar, its going away, not completely, I admit, but things need to get back to normal, and the youth in this country need to get back on the social train. I mean none of this in disrespect, but am looking forward to seeing you all back to the office again someday.....","51"

I'll agree that in the ideal world, people can work from home if their entire job is computer based.  so for this example we will ignore other factors.

But the fact of the matter is, the majority of employers would gladly let everyone work from home 100% instead of paying for a building, equipment, cleaners, utilities and the works.  

People have proven many times that they need to be supervised.  You mention people spending all day away from their family but one of the biggest concerns of work from home jobs is people being distracted and not actually working, especially when it comes to people using WFH jobs as a substitute for childcare.  

I have seen so many posts on here about people being brought back to the office, then talking to their boss about needing time to arrange child care and then they have to have meetings with their superiors because they admitted to being the primary caregiver during their work hours.  

The reason for all the monitoring software mandated by companies is because it's far too common for people to not work during work hours.  Screen sharing, webcams, mouse trackers are all things companies don't want to have to do.  

WFH is 100% a privilege that you earn.  My girlfriend mostly works from the office to avoid distractions, she isn't even required to.  She is 100% allowed to continue working from home along with other high performers from her office.  The only times she uses that privilege is when she has a cold because she is a workaholic and works anyway.","53"

The bosses had nothing to do with it. We have a really strong team and we all genuinely like each other and working together. We run our usual meetings, brainstorm new solutions / products together, go out for lunch and a few beers, and we leave before rush hour traffic. Finish up at home. It's voluntary once a month and yet we get 100% local attendance.

THAT is true collaboration and culture -- it's **organic**. It's not something a soulless suit-and-tie asshole forces everyone to have, like, ""This is your new best friend! Come up with great ideas together RIGHT NOW!""

Most managers don't know how to build a strong team. They don't know how to ask the right questions and mine the right info.

But I DO think those CEOs who do believe that **all** work at their company happens in clumps of 4-7 people, generally crowded around one person sitting at a laptop while several others peer over his shoulder at the screen, with another to his right, pointing at some Eureka! bit on the screen. Meanwhile, another is nearby taking notes on a paper notepad.

Thanks, but I am 2-3 years away from retirement so I will have ageism on top of the tough job market to battle. I've resigned myself to having to go in and just tough it out for a couple of years.  

I have decided that one of my retirement hobbies will be harassing (on SM and anywhere I can) every large RTO-forcing company. One of the arrows in my quiver will be suggesting that they remove the ""we're green"" verbiage from their own SM since they're forcing literal TONS of pollutants to be spewed DAILY by their nonsensical RTO mandates.

Of course it is. And the apparent fact that ALL of the RTO pushers are using that same (or similar) phrasing reinforces my notion that this is being orchestrated from behind the scenes. Very conspiracy-theory-ish of me, I know, but these assholes are singing from the same songbook for a reason.  

&gt;It feels like punishment to have to get up earlier to go to a office building and do the same thing I can do in the comforts of my home office   

If the CRE theory is true (that CRE concerns + dying downtowns are the #1 RTO driver) then it's not so much a punishment as a tax. It's a ""we assumed you peons would have to schlep to offices forever so we over-invested... we therefore hereby FORCE you to resume schlepping to save our asses"" tax. Problem is, only a portion of the $ I spend on RTO will go to that tax, and NONE of the time will. I'd just as soon have been assessed a 5-year CRE/downtown-rescue tax that's, say, 1/3 of what I would have spent commuting (assuming such a tax would be used to reconfigure downtowns and CRE and such... to essentially ""soften the landing"" of permanently reduced CRE/downtown values). At least that way it wouldn't cost me as much and I'd still have all of my time savings.","1_4_1"

I work hybrid about 30 minutes from home now (one way). I often have to choose between eating well, sleeping enough, having a meaningful hobby, exercise, and spending time with my partner/friends/family because the option to do all of them is gone. 

Its not just the commute (1hr, 3x/week). Its the mental load and time/money suck of extra laundry, getting ready in the morning, different groceries, making lunches/snacks, gas, picking audiobooks to stay occupied on the commute, planning time, extra errands to get all of this done. Its a part time job to stay more on top of this stuff. 

I have not ONCE collaborated in 10 months in the office. No one knows I even exist in a cube farm, other than that I show up on a report of whether my badge has been activated enough at a security door or not. 

I cant wait to quit. My work passes all QA and I do what I have to, but not a single thing more. I no longer excel at work. I dont care about my job, my coworkers, or my manager - its all forced for no reason. I havent contributed to any baby funds, gift funds, or volunteer activities. The return for making me go into the office is that I steal back as much time as I can - because theyre stealing my time/money/energy too. Hell yea for 20 minute bathroom breaks - at least my badge says Im at work, right?","6"

I have the same issue, I was forced to RTO to an open plan office with hot desks where we just sit in Teams meetings at our desk.

Been coffee badging for 4+months, still not caught. Luckily my coworkers arent snitches and they hate RTO also, so there is a gentlemans agreement that nobody is snitching on coffee badgers that still get thier work done.

Get over it, I'll say it again, get over it. 

While the ultimate reason for RTO is for companies to regain control, not once in American history did the labor force have permanent leverage over companies. Seeing post after post of people whining about having to report back to work when prior to 2020 that's what EVERYONE did has made me realize we as Americans just love to whine and cry. Great you got to extend your remote work longer than most and take advantage of it. But reality is, it was never going to last. Many on this subreddit love to argue with me about the expectation for RTO by the beginning of 2025. Dell and Amazon have already instituted it for all employees. If Amazon is doing it, what makes anyone think their job is safe from it? It doesn't mean remote work will be gone forever, but it's going to significantly dwindle by January and what we review in my local EDC all point to it. 

My advice for you and the rest, learn to adjust. You got to enjoy something that we never had before but it won't last. Either learn to adapt to a new routine or change jobs but there's no guarantee that will remain remote either","36"

Your advice is correct. Folks like OP (who I wish all the best), need to develop some additional life skills. I worked in an office 5 days/week for 20+ years before Covid and I've had a great life and amazing career. Its all about perspective, time management and realizing value from in-person interaction. No one can tell me that interacting over zoom on a complex topic is better than in-person. Why is quality time better with friends and family in person? In-person interaction is part of the human experience. If you cannot realize this benefit, you are the problem, not the company. 

So you're right, this is the reality and what companies need to succeed. Those that can develop those life skills will succeed. The rest will get there eventually, but it will be a harder road. GLTA.","36_2"

Human interaction is needed, even those who are introverted. We need social interaction, not may need, we do need. 

We all didn't work remotely prior to covid. Sure we griped about commuting, getting up early, but we still did it and we found other ways to make the most of our time. Yet it's like with everything else in America, we are given just a tiny bit of something and it's not good enough we have to have MORE. 

I don't blame them, when I was remote for a year and a half I experienced the same. I got more time with my daughter, I was able to exercise daily, I could wake up later than I do now for work and I could wear shorts (that was a big one for me, I hate pants). But, I can feel it now with just the 1 day I'm remote. At home, as much as I don't like the constant interruptions when I'm working on something, it's different being able to chit chat with people in person in passing.

Being at home provides a buffer to kind of deal with that.

So the real solution is to find a job/career you really enjoy and a team you enjoy working with in-person. Work is a big part of our life (till we retire), so its best to make the most of it.

Here is a little nugget that has stuck with me. Many years ago, standard vacation time was 2 weeks. Companies would tack on an extra week after 5 years of service. I recall one senior engineer once telling me that he would rather have a job that he enjoys with only 2 weeks of rather than a job he can't stand where he has 4 weeks off. This makes sense as most of the time you're at the job. Now, we're very lucky since those days with way more vacation such as FTO.

Again, I wish all the remote workers well, but also be ready to adapt to the ""old reality"" and stop kidding yourself that remote workers are some kind of superior being and that staying physically disconnected from others is somehow better.","36_2_1_1"

He's hired so many people over the last 2 to 3  years because he's watching the bigger shops and has his HR team finding top candidates that are being pushed to RTO.

He has an office space, he downsized it during the pandemic (not that it was some huge affair to begin with), I think they have 3 conf rooms, 2 exec offices, reception, a small open bay area that could fit a team of 10 maybe? kitchen/bathroom.  The office space is mostly used for client meetings, the occasional team will use it to get together, and a once in a blue moon design session where they're doing mockups and what not with a specific team.

He works in the office, his secretary/receptionist works in the office, occasionally you'll see a few others there but for the most part, only time you really see more than 10 people there is when it's a client meeting requiring multiple different people onsite for it.

Only reason he works in office is because he doesn't personally like working from home, too many distractions, too many interruptions, so he uses his office to provide some seclusion.","2_1_3"

Just because people are doing well remote doesn't mean they wouldn't do better in-person.

You also have to consider that it's a manager's job to look past individual performance at how the team in aggregate is delivering. They have to plan for attrition, hiring, onboarding, shifting priorities, etc. while regularly delivering on the \_right\_ things.

I doubt most managers care whether people are remote or not - what they care about is accomplishing the above. Just because people are individually productive remote doesn't actually mean the team is setup for the best success long-term.

And before anyone says ""but there's no data"" - yeah, there isn't. There isn't data for or against remote work. Good managers are kind of like mini-CEOs - everyone bashes CEOs when they make a decision that doesn't work out well, but no one is perfect - and \_every\_ decision a CEO makes is going to have a massive impact, it's impossible to always be right. Managers are really no different.

And it's kind of like farming - there's plenty of academic studies on what should work, but your location, soil, climate, labor availability, skills, capital, etc. all have eto be considered. Same with companies. you can read all the research you want, but the nuances of your industry, company, location, the work you do, and predictions for the future all impact how decisions are made. A manager, at the end of the day, has to decide on what they think will make the team the most productive in the long-term. That's it.","50"

People acting like this is the 70s and nobody knows what's going on. It's completely ridiculous, we know immediately and are equipped to handle it.","67_1_1"

My question is why are employers forcing people back in the office?  I assume it's a bunch of different reasons but I just don't understand.  Most people I've talked to who have to go into an office are miserable about having to go and be there 3 to 4 days a week.  A friend of mine hates it but she gets paid really well and hasn't found anything else yet that is remote.   She hates commuting and sitting around the office working on her laptop which she could do from home.  She is still in a bunch of zoom meetings which she could also do from home.   She said being in the office is pointless to be successful at her job.
One person I know cheats the system by going to the office, badging in, sticking around a few minutes and then leaving because their company only checks badging in and there's no requirement to badge out plus no one in the office cares cause most are doing the same.   Some at my company go in because they actually don't mind being in the office but they also aren't required to go in either...it's their choice.","22"

Among remote workers, I think there is a bias in the sample where people allowed to work remotely tend to be the most competitive/sought after employees who get to have the benefit of remote work, because of trust that they will perform well. In essence, they are the most competitive fraction of the labor force competing for those coveted remote jobs.

In fact, I worked in a corporate real estate group responsible for gearing executives towards desk sharing back in the early 2000s. We ran several occupancy studies in real-time. Only 50-60 percent of employees were at their desk at any given time; a majority of the time, employees were engaged in socializing activities versus meetings, or at the copier, etc. 

I think it was IBM who piloted desk sharing ideas and in that study, it was documented that commute times were significant as well.

I haven't seen official statistics recently, but I know for a fact that I personally am absolutely WAYYYY more productive working at home. I can control most of my distractions, I start work earlier and end later each day too. OR..if I have to miss work for an appointment, I am able to make up the day's work later that same day as opposed to having to make it up the next day in the office (no computer at home if in-person full time!).

So many other examples of increased productivity, but this is the nutshell from my experience.","8"

I saw a Chinese experiment that showed remote workers are more productive but in office workers are preferred for promotions and whatnot. That time spent away from the desk, having coffee with coworkers, chatting by the printer, etc, are all ways to strengthen ties and improve collaboration.

Personally, I'm the person with the most tenure in my team and I've been working here since we were all office based so I know a lot of people in the company and I know who to go to for what. Even remotely, there are coworkers who will reply to me faster, and clearly trust me better, than to other people in my team. This is something that definitely helps make the work run smoother.

Productivity has two dependencies - you and your employer. I am ten times more productive at home. I spend more time focused on work than I am in an office. I did a stent back in an office for about 6 years during this time. Constant interruptions, and I have ADHD which needs zero assistance with distraction. Now, your WFH company culture comes into play. Can your boss and other people leaders actually manage WFH employees? Are your executives good communicators and inclusive with information? Do you have tools in place to support knowledge sharing and information exchange? Productivity in most companies is not measured like they claim unless your job has very clear KPIs and targets. I am happier at home, less stress with zero commute. My actual compensation has more buying power at home. All of these things equal more productive people. The one thought that I think is never mentioned, I have at least 14 hours or so in a day to complete work at home. I can stop and come back when I can. I am not shoving my entire day into one 7 hour span. It gives more time to process and still complete projects on-time but more thoughtfully because I am not rushed to do this by 5pm. What a lot of corporations are not liking about WFH is people are no longer geography locked into the employer of choice for that ZIP code.

Commuting is a huge drain on productivity.

When it takes 25-50+ minutes to drive 7 miles, it's just a ridiculous waste of time.  It's always been this way in Silicon Valley.  But then, there used to be times when we'd literally make a single day business trip to our SoCal office to (optimistically) get 4 hours of work and ""face time"" done.  It was like 6+ hours of traveling for 4 hours of benefit.

On the other side, there are negatives involved with actually working in an office that nobody wants to talk about.  Some coworkers are just better off, for themselves and sometimes everyone around them, working remotely.  In an office, there is a ridiculous number of potential interruptions every day.  I couldn't count how many times people would just stop by my office for 15 minutes to talk about something, often personal.  I also couldn't believe, just listening to people in cubes outside my office while I was working, how often people would just stand around talking for over an hour at a time.

Bottom line, the option of remote working increases productivity in general.  Sometimes it's better just to force people to work remotely because they tend to lose productivity in an office, but it's all about the bottom line results and the person managing them.

For some reason US work culture has misconstrued ""productivity"" to reflect going above and beyond what is expected of you in your role. To me, that would be more accurately described as ""overachievement.""

To answer your question, no - I don't believe remote workers are necessarily ""more productive"" however, I do believe that remote are in fact productive and their jobs can be done while balancing their daily life needs.

The two hours it took me to get up, shower, get dressed, eat breakfast, do my hair, drive to work, and then get logged in. All of that fails to factor in any changes/impacts to that timeline. Kids, missing wallet, drive through breakfast, traffic, etc. 

Then once in office, time is wasted left and right. Conversations took up wayyy too much of my day. On average 2-3 hours. People walking into an office and asking questions, chit chatting, water cooler, coffee talk, all of the chit chat is now intentional. The loss of productivity in stoping what I was doing, having a conversation, then jumping back into what I was doing easily makes me 50% more efficient in just that aspect alone. 

Add in eating healthier because I dont have to eat fast food when I dont take the time to pack a lunch makes my afternoons soooo much less sleepy. I would eat a taco bell 5 dollar box 2-3 times a week when in office. I would get very tired and lethargic in the afternoon and sometimes even take a walk to refocus myself. 

Locking up, putting things away, stopping productivity just because its a distinct time of day rather than being done with a task, or not starting a task because its too late in tue day to get something going just to stop it. Chats die down, and I hunker down at the end of my day. Carrying over significantly less work into the next day. 

My mental state has improved. The time and money I spent getting to work or supporting being at work has improved. I am a significantly better worker in many ways, and as such am easily twice as productive on my worst days.","58"

When I was in the office yesterday, a colleague I sat by was loudly talking ALL day long. Granted, it was work related, but nothing that needed to be spoken about.

When I left my desk for water and the restroom, I was constantly stopped by colleagues who talked about nothing nonstop. I consider myself a social person, but its so taxing. Especially when Im trying to get work done.

When I WFH, I feel like I have more control over my schedule. If someone needs to meet, I can send a TEAMS invite and its scheduled.

And some issues do need immediate attention. That doesnt annoy me at all. But when something absolutely can wait for a scheduled meeting, thats when I get a bit cranky. And sadly, you have to waste more energy keeping your cool about it all while in a professional setting. 

All of this combined with the commute, its such a waste of every resource available. 

When I WFH, I take breaks and my lunch. When Im in the office, I often dont to stay caught up. So when I come home on office days, Im literally spent and was only able to produce less than half of the amount of work I get done when WFH.

Today with remote no one is quitting, very hard to justify a promotion or fast tracking a person. Since you can recruit anywhere why pay NYC salaries when can get someone remote from Florida. 

People are now forced to do multiple remote jobs under the table, be two income, have side hustles. Your job you dread in remote HR pops up one day in zoom meeting and you are fired.

I know theres the mindset of at least its not five days but also you could work from home five days a week so why arent we talking about that?

When I was in office I had a similar commute to you. Maybe an extra fifteen minutes each way. I dont think people realize how much it eats up your day and youre not even getting paid for it. Not to mention the hour unpaid lunch. So thats like 3 hours of unpaid time per day and you could be doing so much with that time. On my office days I was always much more exhausted after work than my work from home days. I would even get headaches those days.

I think hybrid is stupid because it makes it difficult to get into a consistent routine. Its good for you to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day so I would have to get up super early on my work from home days for no reason if I wanted to maintain that.

I agree that there isnt a good reason to work in office when you have all your meetings virtually anyway. Nobody can focus because its loud and people interrupt. You get no control over lighting, temperature, noise levels. You dont have food and drinks or a bathroom 10 steps away. How is any of that helpful for focusing?

Then theres the unsettling feeling of knowing they can and probably will add more days at any time, just when you get used to a specific schedule.
And I dont know about you but RTO has also made management less flexible. A hybrid schedule wouldnt be so bad if it was flexible.

This is a great point that I don't see a lot of people talking about. I'm old enough to remember when tech entered the workplace. It was sold as a way to create shortcuts for workers, ease of communication, and a more efficient work experience overall. There was A TREMENDOUS amount of talk about 'the four-day workweek' and now whenever I talk to someone who is trying to ring me up, or figure something out for me and they express trepidation over 'it taking so long' because they're waiting for whatever to work/restart, etc. and their frustration with whatever, I reassure them and say 'you're good,  tech can be wonky - I'm still waiting for that four-day workweek.'

That honestly has a lot to do with why I am not a fan of tech for every aspect of my life. I often think about what it was like when I would say, type an invoice out on a typwriter and yes - it took longer, but you know what? That was the only thing I had to do at that moment in time. At jobs post that experience my workload increased tremendously at a rate that didn't match my pay. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not anti-tech. Metrics are great and all - when they are accurate and do more than say 'buy our stuff, because the customers who responded--and the fact that all of them didn't respond is in the fine print--say we're great.' There is some great software out there that does help people, but my experience has been that there is a lot more software/tech that sucks and somehow people have been conned into paying for it and/or working harder for less pay, diminished QOL, and crappier work environments. It may be different in settings with specialized skillsets, but most of the people I know are low-income and/or public-facing to some degree, (nurse, lab tech, lawyer, educators, etc.) and prior to teaching I worked as a receptionist/secretary, etc.

Lets look for a new job each and every time the company we work at begins to treat their employees like garbage. I mean, switching roles/companies isnt a pain in the ass or anything! 

All you have to do is adjust your resume for each and every position you apply for, apply directly through each companys *unique* web application process, possibly create individual cover letters for each application, eventually *one* schedule an interview after tens of hours spent applying for jobs, spend additional hours preparing for said interview, coordinate to arrange the interview and/or your current work schedule to have the interview, and likely repeat all of the above processes when you aren't hired as a result of the many many reasons a job may not be offered. not to mention the many hoops you go through to transition ti a new company and role.

I'm sorry, but this is such an oversimplified bs response to a complex problem. Anyone who's been in the workforce knows that switching jobs is a job in itself. Now if the suggestion is to switch jobs to attain a pay increase, then thats understandable. But thats a totally different discussion, which is not what we are talking about here.

It absolutely should *NOT* be the norm to switch jobs merely because a company is putting you through hell. We all need to work toward pressuring our employers to actually incentivize people to want to work for them. This means talking to your coworkers and making alliances. It presenting what might be uncomfortable conversations in a team setting. Without taking any active steps like this, we are destined to repeat the same bullshit cycle.","1_2_1_2_4_1"

Ours started out two days a week of our choice and it was meant to be flexible so that we could switch our days as needed when things came up like a maintenance worker at your apartment or something like that.

Then they became two very strict days where you couldnt leave early or switch your days or anything. Then it became three days and they were considering picking one of the days for everyone. 

They started implementing no doctors appointments during work hours so you would have to plan them before or after work. Like just straight up ridiculous stuff. They would track badge swipes and I think also check how long your computer is connected to their network and if you were even a little off, the manager pushing for all of this would give you a call about it. Ironically, Ive never met this manager in person because she works in an office across the country. I would go work in a focus room so that I could focus better since the office was loud and crowded and that wasnt allowed either. I truly felt like I had more freedom in elementary school.

You sound like an ass, but I want to give you the benefit of the doubt, so here it goes.

My chronic illnesses are asthma - which everyone in the office is a smoker, the smoke blows in from the warehouse, where they smoke, to the attached office, where I work. 

I also have migraines. The insurance we have covers meds, but not a neurologist, so they are trying me on different meds to see if anything works, before I have to pay out of pocket trying to figure out what the fuck is wrong. 

I vomit from migraines, get vertigo, light sensitivity, etc. It fucking sucks and it has taken out fun days as well as work days. Why would I want to encourage more of them from the shit at work that makes them more frequent.

I do not make the choice to smoke, but I am subjected to second hand smoke every time I am in the office. Tell me again to check my privilege when I am asking for the same concessions my predecessor had.

A construction zone is unfortunate and out of anyone's hands, and if there truly is no other route to work, you do have to realize it's only temporary.

I would honestly LOVE to be back in the office. I'm 100% remote, but since I'm in TN and my employer is in AL, it's not possible. The lack of in-person social interaction alone has severely degraded my mental health. Also, even the minor exercise required to walk around the office to do basic tasks used to benefit my mental health.

I'm sure this will be down-voted, but I never realized how ungrateful people are to even have the jobs that they do have.. the freedom to even partially WFH, until I joined this sub. There will always be tons of people to replace you if you're stressed over a temporary 45 minute commute, 2 days a week, or a lack of ""natural lighting,"" when you can easily use your 15 minute break / lunch break to step outside and get ""natural light"" or fresh air.","51"

You named a lot of things you could do to make your day better, headphones, artificial sunlight lamps to start... companies mostly never supply things like this, but you certainly could if it helps.

A 15 mile commute could take up to an hour, and I had to be in office twice a week,  I was fully remote for several years in AZ, but took a higher paying job in CA to be close to family. 

Initially, it was the worst decision ever.  I hated the commute, people wouldnt let me work, I felt so unproductive.  I had to change my perspective. I started coming in an hour early to work out (workplace had a gym).  This made my commute feel quicker.  I brought my car own light from home to make it feel like it was my space, and office lights suck.

Since I wasnt able to avoid people,  I tried to be open minded about them. I started networking and hanging out with different departments for lunch.  I shared an office with another person, and she and I would alternate music selection in the morning and afternoon. 

It made things way better for me, and much more tolerable.  I wasnt friends with people, but I was friendly and helpful. I got on a few projects, and eventually got another full WFH in the same company, which lead to several  promotions and bumps in pay.

I know it sucks, but if you try to change your perspective on things, you can make it tolerable, even fun.  Im wishing you the best of luck.","75"

You can do three things about it:

- suck it up /show gratitude (I have a hybrid job and ruined a pair of shoes wading through mud to get to my office for onsite work, but at least I wasn't working out in that mud)

- change what you find the most offensive (I can't handle the din of a shared office during the mid-morning energy rush so I bought some noise-cancelling sennheisers on my own dime, expensive but my QoL is better)

- leave (I don't like the area my office is situated in so I got a different position that has an office in a more suitable climate)

In truth, I recommend all three. People will probably down vote my saying, 'suck it up buttercup' but there is a balance to be struck between bitching about discomforts and forming tolerance/resilience. Yes, if there's a better option take it, but also don't be so fragile that you can't develop tolerance to smaller issues.","90"

Because the supply of the work you do at home is much, MUCH greater and the value of your work is a function of demand vs supply.

There are orders of magnitude more possible candidates for remote positions than there are for in office ones. At best, you're competing against the entire country. At worst, the world. Compared to an in office job where you're only competing against people within commute distance.

If you have 3 qualified candidates for a position, that position is going to cost the company more than if you have 3,000 qualified candidates. It's far more likely that there's someone just as good as you or better willing to work for cheaper in the entire country than within 40 miles of your office.","1_1_1_1_4_1"

We recently helped a Massachusetts company convert their entire accounting team to fully remote from local in office. The jobs moved to Americans in Puerto Rico at a savings of nearly 40% labor costs.

I didn't do that. I did some job hopping to get into another field, am in a contract role that's hybrid 2 days in office. Issue that happened, is simply that we have to desk swap (so there is no way to bring everyone back 5 days a week at this point). 

However, they moved offices, and now half the staff are traveling an hour and a half each way for their commutes. I am fortunate it reversed that for me.

The job market is harsh, no matter what news says, etc, at this point. Plus, I'm older. While most of us need to work and retire after age 67 or such, a lot of companies are forcing people into retirement. The average retirement age now is 62 as a result. So, the issue with social security and the reality going on is, people are broke, and places aren't hiring older workers anymore.

Going into the office runs about $50 per day, so you are losing about $150 per week for the change out of your pay. You can do many things, but my guess is they know people will quit, and probably are counting on it.","45"

Mayer was a (typically) dishonest CEO. She did a big press tour when she got hired, she was one of the first 20 or so people to get hired at Google and she talked a big talk about bringing big Google energy to Yahoo.

The reality is she was very, very likely brought on from the very beginning to find a buyer dumb enough to overpay for Yahoo, securing a modest payout for Yahoo's investors and a golden parachute for herself. 

Part of what needed to happen to achieve this was improving Yahoo's short term financial outlook, so a hamfisted RTO order that the company knew would result in many remote employees simply resigning (e.g. ""soft layoffs"") helped achieve that.

She promoted / introduced various ""initiatives"" that had the veneer of trying to turn Yahoo around, but her real purpose and ultimate goal was getting someone to buy Yahoo. During a good chunk of her tenure Yahoo's stock price improved--largely because she cut head count and because years before Mayer was brought on, Yahoo had made a minor investment in a Chinese company, Alibaba. At the time it wasn't a big player, by the early 2010s it was an eCommerce giant in China, and in spite of Yahoo!'s overall failing business, its small stake in Alibaba grew so large that it made Yahoo's overall valuation go up.

Yahoo's real business continued to fail, share price eventually declined again, at one point multiple large institutional investors were pushing for her to fired--at one point articles came out arguing that Yahoo's core business was actually ""worth $0"" and generating functionally no revenue. Mayer had shrunk head count by 50% in her tenure and collected over $200m in salary and bonuses. She managed a win in the end by somehow convincing a very stupid Verizon CEO to pay $4bn for the largely worthless Yahoo, she got over $20m in the buyout.

Verizon combined Yahoo with its prior AOL purchase to try to make some sort of play in digital advertising, between the two companies it had paid $9bn to acquire them. It eventually wrote down their valuation by $4.6bn (and a lot of that was devaluing Yahoo, shockingly the AOL properties still retained some value.) Verizon offloaded the combined entity to private equity after a few years at around a $4bn loss versus the $9bn price to acquire both firms.","2"

The hypocrisy astounded then, and it astounds today.  One major RTO proponentthe current CEO of the company that helped make WFH possible and had its own teleworkers with tenures going back to 1999now has his direct-reporting CTO in another city in a different time zone.

How do they ""collaborate,"" you may ask?  By private jet, of course. (And more than one.)

I think it's a function of company size and maturity. Smaller companies are happy to be agile and hire from anywhere and get it.

Some older companies got too big and want to show off so they buy a bunch of real estate and made HQ1 and HQ2, etc.  There's probably some tax scams/incentives too.

Another big company I worked at, already ""mature"" began shifting pre-covid, encouraging WFH and downsizing their footprint. Not surprisingly,  this one is growing faster, relatively speaking","2"

most employers don't own their offices, if they do (e.g. MSFT Redmond campus) it's only a small part of the office footprint in the area.

fewer people in office means less rent expense.

the idea that companies just moonlight in investments in real estate, or that the CEO personally owns the real estate the company rents is ludicrous. The situations where it happened (e.g. WeWork) are considered outrageous self-dealing.

RTO has a few reasons

* Some cities have tax abatement agreements that require a certain number of employees to be in-office
* Some companies (e.g. law firms, investment banks) really and truly rely on in-person interactions to train substantive knowledge and transmit culture.
   * There's a whiff of that for a lot of other companies where it's more about intention than reality. Still a reason for doing it, just a stupid reason.
* Some companies (e.g. Amazon) use RTO as a way to cull the workforce without paying severance
* Some companies use ""hybrid"" as a way to make sure employees live in the area for one reason or another
* Some managers just like to walk around and see their empire of workers, a stupid reason but a reason nontheless
* Some managers use it as a fundamental check on how busy people are. If you walk around the office you can get a sense of who is busy and allocate more work to that person. If all you know is that the work is being done you don't know that people are working to their ability.","3_2_7"

I think the rto argument that everyone should be in office absurd. 

There is no one answer. So thats why I find the argument that this is about real estate to be silly. If it was cheaper for me to have everyone at home and didnt impact my business I would do it. But we were not more productive and our customer experience was worse. 

It is so weird to me how after four years of this argument I never hear anyone admit that they are less productive at home because they cant access everyone immediately. Some people are awesome at it - I have two. I would like them here but they do great at home and that is their preference so thats what we do.

Taking it further.. We also monitor screens and specific activity in real time with software we developed to help us keep tabs on remote workers. What started as a small project because we didn't like the pricing and some of the missing features with tools like Teramind or Veriato, has really taken off for monitoring remote workers and we spun that dev team off into a separate company. 


What we have observed fairly consistently is that gaps in actual work are larger at home than when in the office, which correlates to the productivity gains and profit gains we observe in the office. We can toggle from user to user and screen to screen instantly, and we developed an alert system that flags suspected jigglers and other fake activity tools.

While real estate investors might be motivated to push for RTO, it makes no sense that a lessee would care.  Ive signed the lease and I must pay for it.  WFH vs RTO does not change that I need to pay for it, and RTO takes away my ability to better control my labor costs. 

As a lessee, Im going to reconfigure my leased space to better suit the needs of those that cant be WFH.  This could mean that site staff get larger offices, or production environments receive new layouts to improve efficiency.  I run a medical system, were using WFH to reduce the pressure to lease more space to see patients.  Now that our admin team is no longer on site, the space they used to occupy can be used for additional diagnostic and treatment centers.  Certainly there are some lessees that are victim to the sunk cost fallacy, but I strongly suspect that is not the most common motivating factor.

Here's what I think are more likely reasons for RTO:

1. **Reduce/Realign staffing**: I do think it is reasonable to assume that some RTO efforts are just meant to offload staff without needing to pay severance or unemployment.  It tracks with efforts from pre-covid like moving an office to a new city or state.
2. **Collaboration**:  Virtual collaboration still sucks.  Humans are social and trying to do that by Facetime just leaves a lot to be desired.  Within my own group, we moved from in-person to virtual meetings during the pandemic.  Our board meetings changed from collaborative planning meetings to essentially a monthly earnings call.
   1. I do agree that a lot of collab sessions arent actually collab sessions and can totally be handled virtually.
   2. I also agree that the impact of this varies greatly not only due to the industry but also the type of team that you are working on.
   3. I also agree that a lot of the lost nuance of virtual can be made up for by periodic in-person meetings.
3. **Avoiding overemployment**: I get the concept of if the work is getting done why does it matter.  I also OE but only for work that is asynchronous.  Ive had to let go of plenty of people that had synchronous roles (think support roles) that were trying to OE while on the clock for us.  They were let go for performance issues, not for having a second job, but the performance issues were caused by the second job.  There are just too many people that latch on to a concept and assume it is a one-size-fits-all situation.
4. **Tax incentives**: Cities are offering up tax breaks for maintaining a certain amount of staffing presence in their commercial districts.  A good business leader would not pass these up.  Until citizens put pressure on cities to have these areas rezoned to mixed use, well keep seeing this problem over and over again.

Also, Id point out that there are plenty of employees that think WFH is bad.  I had to fire an employee recently that insisted we move everyone back to on-site; and when we refused she started on a campaign of sabotage telling staff that were bankrupt and their paychecks wont be cashed in the coming weeks.  Oddly enough, she was the only one who she thought it made sense should be WFH.  Why?  Because she only wanted to do a very specific part of her job and insisted everything else could only be done on site.","15"

I keep hearing the real estate excuse and do not see it as the major reason for RTO.  It mostly comes down to whether a company used WFH prior to the pandemic or not.  The companies that already had the infrastructure to do it just added more staff to the system.  Covid gave companies that were designed to be in office little choice.  

I've said before when you tick off reasons for the move back, how the employees acted is a major factor.  Some took to it but the majority of caught in the lock downs began to take liberties that were never acceptable in an office environment.","15_1"

Our company just went through a process to map each employee to the closest office to where they live rather than to the office they worked previously or were associated (lots of pre-Covid remote employees). Then each office was assigned into 1 of 4 cost of labor markets. In doing year end salary reviews, we are to evaluate salaries within these labor market ranges, and then decrease or zero out annual adjustments if pay is already above the targeted percentile we aim to pay in the employees newly assigned labor market. So as you describe, not a pay cut, but pay growth has been neutered. Where the pay discrepancies are large, I can see the scenario you encountered of the no-raise promotion.

The corpoprate and tech environment were the main places where remote work was possible and now those things are changing to be AI native. We know that in the future we're going to need to downsize. We need the human component of our workplace to be a group of ""super communicators"". Using totally technically competent no longer matters. AI technology will allow a person to handle numerous roles and will allow us to do much more with much fewer people. But we need these people to be capable Pilots (AI users), and be capable people people. As in a people person. Being in office makes sure we can find who those future leaders are going to be. This what I'm trying to get across. Steve in the nice suit who plays solitaire all day but attends all meetings, is always in office, and drinks with is coworkers after hours is going to me a much better candidate than Eric in a T-shirt and jeans who complains about office noise, wants to work from home, relies only on his technical competence at his work to stay employed. 

The mindset of business is a value mind set. We need to use our time with our real estate to find these capable Pilots and leaders. You're going to see lots of layoffs as the economy takes a downturn and jobs are automated away. Frankly, yes I think at least for the next 10 years WFH will be dead. In like 10+ years I have to imagine it'll start becoming more common as jobs done in person will also start to be automated away.","95"

Making their hiring more competitive and more likely to get the best candidates at potentially lower prices. 

Companies that own real estate have a vested interest in getting workers to RTO to minimize real estate losses. Some jobs are not possible to do from home, it can be harder to train up a less experienced workforce when WFH, and lazy management can find it easier to manage their workforce.","96"

Why are you all surprised that Amazon is aware of these games and it is making it more difficult to play them?

Just because you may be truly disabled doesn't mean you have a ""right"" to work at Amazon, pull down a huge paycheck, and WFH.  If WFH is really that important to you, there are plenty of jobs out there that support WFH.  Go get one.  Amazon has decided it doesn't want to allow that benefit any longer.  WFH is not a right, it is a benefit and something that is VERY privileged.  Go find somewhere else to do it.","20"

Either way the extra time and money spent can make a remote job that is the same or slightly less than an office job have a way higher value. 

At the very least if you figure out the difference between the time you devote to work ( getting ready, taking care of dependents, commuting, making and bring food/buying it there, wasting time walking 10 minutes to an occupied meeting room for a meeting that will have no purpose and already has half the people on a video screen several times a day, getting sick for days or weeks over the course of the year from office mates in your open office) vs actually doing it (roll out of bed, work, still have time to do stuff, repeat) and multiply by your hourly worth over a year the massive difference between wfh and RTO can be surreal.","1_2_1"

I get all my work done. I am available for calls and messages. I am always ahead of schedule on projects. And on the days when I do have active work and WFH, I am far more productive than when I'm in the office.

Makes them feel good about themselves that theyre doing something good and being paid attention to, but their first priority isnt actually solving the problem and/ or they dont really know what steps to take to do so.

So while you have environmentalists failing to strike at a huge moment of opportunity, youve also got all sorts of influential folks with huge vested interests in RTO doing their thing.  Its real money to them, not a side gig they do for fun, they know how to effectively get stuff done and they arent playing.

Stop and think about how much money is tied to people commuting to work (gas, car sales, car insurance, repair, work clothes, etc) and staying there all day (going out to lunch, office rent, bank loans being paid back with that rent, often tax breaks tied to people being employed at a specific location).  Compared to volunteer activists and a largely indifferent public (even though WFH would benefit the public in numerous ways beyond the environment) and its a combination that leads to a return to the pre-COVID status quo.","13"

You are probably subject to a clause somewhere in your employee handbook or technology acceptable use policy that will state you have ""no reasonable expectation of privacy"" when dealing with work systems.

If it is a work-provided computer, then it's all the more likely that they can set things up to do periodic ""sampling"" of your webcam, desktop, open files, etc.

If it's your hardware, and you're ""only"" accessing company resources (cloud-based, VPN, etc) then it gets a bit more grey (using your camera on your hardware...vs ...company protecting its assets, while you're on their time, and accessing their systems/data/customers....), but could still be covered by ""no reasonable expectation of privacy"" rules around the job.

To be clear - I'm with you. Feels...scummy/creepy/gross to take it to that level, especially without clear and repeated notice of what's going on.

As an IT person who's had to explain ""no privacy"" stuff to end users before - I also do my best to push back on the companies I've worked for when they want to over-reachnand turn managerial problems (making sure your staff get their work done) into a technology problem (making sure I'm at my computer by snapping a photo every couple hours).

I'm fond of explaining ""just because we CAN do something, doesn't mean we should"" - and then point out things like, having the right to go into someone's desk to look for contraband... and should we regularly do that? Should we rifle through the CEO's desk?

If it is and you agreed to it, you could get terminated for covering up your camera. 

Things like this have gotten very common in remote jobs because of morons making up stories to news on how they do nothing all day. Or take care of their children and do a little work&etc. people dont read their NDAs or offer letters because everyone is excited and wants to start working. I dont. I read EVERYTHING. Actually found a higher salary by reading through the details once. They held up their end. Which I didnt think would happen. 

If there is no mention of performance monitoring tools like web cam recordings or random screen shots (look at any brand names they mention too), I would simply cover up my camera and always keep a task page on my screen. 
Never look at anything personal on work computers. Theres always a way of tracking that besides cache. Basically, anything you do on your work computer is owned by your company. Most NDAs Ive read throughout my career has said as much. Any device that contains any of your work content can also be considered company property. So when people ask me why I dont have my work email or teams/slack..etc on my phone, I usually tell them its because of the NDA. This gets you out of being able to be contacted outside of work hours too. If there is an emergency, HR and my boss has my phone number and knows how to reach me. 

Remote jobs do have things like this from time to time. Ive seen them but never worked for a company that did this. Personally, I think its crappy behavior and I take it as a form of negativity before me proving my worth. Which makes me think theyre being the ones sketchy.

As much as I miss not having a commute; I dont miss the micromanagement that came with remote work starting circa 2023 to present. 

At my onsite job, people take smoke breaks, coffee breaks, bathroom breaks and no one bats an eye. If you need a break from computer screens and phones nobody cares as long as the work is done. 

If someone makes a mistake or misses a deadline that isnt super costly to the company its a slap on the wrist and not a big ordeal because management knows for sure you got caught up in some other work related task and not because you were slacking off. 

When I was working remote under a micromanager, even small mistakes or missed deadlines were taken more seriously and you were put on an uncomfortable watch period until they found someone new to target.

In my onsite job, you are innocent until proven guilty. At my remote job - everyone was guilty and you had to prove your innocence day in and day out.

I know theres probably a few good remote companies that dont micromanage left but given my experience working remotely and as an HR/recruitment coordinator I wouldnt go fully remote again. I feel like hybrid is the best bet because you get to build relationships and trust from your coworkers on your onsite days so theyre more likely to leave you be on the days youre remote.

What about people with spouses or children around at times? Ever work from your bed while under the weather? Have your kids or significant other run in half (or less) dressed because they need something unexpectedly? You get the idea. Even if you agreed to whatever policy other members of the household didnt. Its hard to imagine that most wfh employees have a 100% dedicated room with the door always shut and no visitors.

Fwiw I have a piece of electrical tape over mine. I maybe take it off once a year for something when I really want to be on camera otherwise it stays in place. Obviously this is company culture dependent, Im on a lot of calls with clients where someone jumps in the meeting with their camera on. Usually people notice that some dont have camera on and shut down without saying a word. I have seen all kinds of embarrassing things in meetings with peoples cameras unintentionally on ranging from standing up with no pants on to spouse walking up naked teasing not realizing the other spouse was in a meeting w camera on. If those happen in meetings think about what gets captured with a camera capture that people dont know or remember might be on.

If I log on early, I log off early.

I almost always take lunch away from the desk unless I'm in the flow.

I use the morning to generally warm up, then after I have lunch I power through my creative process (designer). This isn't always the case, but I often don't really feel like I'm firing on all 12 cylinders until I've had more than breakfast.

8:00 am- 9:30/ 10:00 am starting with the tedious stuff in the morning that doesnt require involvement of others. No breaks (even bathroom breaks) until I check at least 3 off

10:00 am- noon Mid morning calls/ prospecting outreach follow ups until noon-

Noon-exercise, no excuses do it, schedule it. If you have a meeting do it before, if you cant do it afterwards. There are 100s of channels on YouTube that dont even require weights (if you have them even better) Im fortunate that my wife also works from home and we hold each other accountable, but even on days when she cant I still do it as it is a form of meditation and 100000% keeps me motivated

1:00-3:00 calls, client meetings,  collaborative calls with coworkers etc. 

3:00 lunch at my desk weather permitting a 30 minute walk afterwards

4:00-6:00 follow ups, if I couldnt walk earlier walk after 6:00

Anything within your control that didnt get checked off the list starts the new list the next day 

After 6:00 or on weekends do NOT go near your desk

If you don't have set hours, pick a time to start and a time to stop, and stick to it.  
Give yourself at least 30 minutes without screen time before you start, and when you hit your 5 o'clock.  
Go for a walk in the morning, work out, do some chores... and same when you're done.  
If you need to get back to work, take your laptop to the living room.   
You wouldn't go back to the office on a Wednesday night.

Wake up 1-2 hours before your shift. Get anything done for yourself that you need to do. Remember that job you had before where you had to commute an hour? Well now you just got that hour to do your own stuff. This is your time to make breakfast, prep lunch, exercise, pay bills, do the stuff that isnt fun. This is to get you in the work/productivity mindset the key here is to stay busy and not get trapped in bed scrolling until your shift starts.

Then before work take a shower or go for a walk to reset your brain. Give yourself 15-30 minutes to clear your mind before work, last thing you want is to have other tasks on your mind when you start work. Once work starts, you can begin your work schedule usually I set a 30 minute timer and check email. Then I set another timer for an hour and a half and start working on projects. Then I take a short break. Continue chugging along setting a timer. Try not to go more than 2 hours without taking a break but if you find yourself not working set your timer for shorter time period and try to keep it all productive. 

Some tips if you notice your time isnt being used well. Set smaller chunks and start logging your time. For example you might want to set a 30 minute work time. 5 minute reset time. Log the time. Just keep track of what you did and how productive you were. I measure productivity based on feel, if the time went quickly and I feel like I could have kept going then that was an A. If I just lulled around doing something but not getting any real work done thats a C or D. If I ended up actively browsing Reddit or scrolling TikTok for more than 5 minutes its usually an instant F because the rest of the time wont be that productive anyways. 

Keep track of your metrics and strive to average a B for the day. Most people are not going to be perfect. I average 6 productive hours of the 8 hours I spend at my desk but its not all A+ productivity. Some days I do really bad but I just need to reassess and go back to basics.","39"

* I have one of those dumb colored lights.  Set it do either a very white or slightly blue color during the work day.  Then switch to a darker almost orange color when you're not at work.  Never relax with the white light on and never do work with the orange light on.  Your brain will start to see the same space as two different places with two different modes.
* Look into a pomodoro timer.  For super boring stuff, working only 15-30 mins followed by a 5-10 min break is the best way I've found to stay on top of it.
* Get some kind of standing desk.  That's been huge for me.","54"

Love the suggestions already of routine, get ready like you would for work (although I do this much, much less nowadays).

If you havent already &amp; have the ability to, I highly recommend designating a work space, &amp; dont intermix it with your leisure space (e.g, dont bring your laptop to bed or on the couch or at your dining table).

If your schedule is flexible, make note of when you login &amp; the amount of work youre doing. Im someone who takes full advantage of a creative burst &amp; Ill work late into the night when Im in the zone, but I always document it &amp; flex it out elsewhere. I deserve my time back.

Set boundaries. I have my email &amp; teams channel on my phone, but I routinely use the away messages (busy, be right back, I stepped away). When Im occupied, even if I am technically still reachable, I dont respond until Ive fully returned to my work space &amp; update the away message. It sets that boundary, but also the expectation for my coworkers to know, Ope, shes away. Shell get to it when shes back. Instead of omg where are you?! Answer me! If Im up doing something around the house, but I want to still be available, I make status available &amp; just turn my notifications on my phone. So I can respond immediately if I need to.

Schedule some breaks on your calendar. I give myself little time windows throughout the day when I might want to take an eye break or a lunch (Ill move them around if I need to for meetings or projects). Most often I take this time to get up &amp; move; do things around the house or actually get out of the house entirely. It helps return to work rejuvenated instead of burnt out or bored. I was someone when working in person that stayed in my works break room for every break, so it ended up feeling like I never really left.

Like others have suggested, if you have more free time look into little professional development opportunities like webinars &amp; workshops &amp; add them to your calendar. I set a goal for myself for how many Id like to do a month (helps stay on track with performance evaluation goals too). Ill even write up the descriptions &amp; outcomes into the calendar event so I can just plug &amp; chug for when evaluation time comes.

On the same note, take some of your free time to work on the performance evaluation stuff throughout the year instead of waiting till the time rolls around. Writing out the outcomes, activities, whatever your evaluation entails. Doing it throughout the year as you do them gives you a clearer idea &amp; better understanding of what you really did to prove to your supervisor.

Schedule project management tike blocks on your calendar. This can sometimes not work in tandem with your creative flow, but it helps at least direct me. If theres a big project or a due date coming up, Ill block out some consistent time on my calendar specifically for project management, Tuesdays/Thursdays 2-4pm work on the XXX project. Most times Ill still mark it free to let others know I can still be available for a meeting or whatever, but its more to organize &amp; fill my day to stay on task.

All that to say, Im still very flexible with my work time, &amp; I like it that way. If I want to go have lunch with my sister for 2 hours, I do. If I want to go grocery shopping, I do. If I want to work in my garden for a little bit, I do. If I wake up &amp; roll out of bed &amp; wait to take a shower after the first meeting, I do.","116"

I've been doing this for almost a decade now. I'll say there's been a huge uptick post-COVID-19 in the demand of people wanting to work from home. These last 2 years I've experienced no shortage of brokenness in this industry. I'm very understanding as to why now companies are forcing people back in offices for ""collaboration"" Broken software, lazy employees, lack of oversight, lack of peer review, etc. I'm talking about companies that have always been a WFH first-type gig. Contracting for trillion-dollar companies It takes a certain level of independence to want to do this. TikTok has everyone thinking we are working on a beach, while babysitting our kids carefree.

I'm referring to technical jobs here in the development/ai/IT space, I can't imagine how bad low-skill jobs have it like a call center for example.

I got called negative, and a gatekeeper by plenty when I was expressing my opinions during Covid about how we are going to have an influx of lazy and incompetent people, wanting the ""easy life"" Then I saw all those tism Toks being shared on Reddit about why you should work from home. I'm scared at this point companies that have been doing this with 0 issues pre covid are about to go under because the talent and hiring pool applying bottom line is getting even lower.

I work for a multi-trillion-dollar company so I'll say my opinion probably outweighs 99% of people here, unless you have an active or prior technical skill set, I don't think working from home should be an option for the time being. Even for those who do, there are plenty of people who need their hand held without realizing it. Most people whom worked from home prior to 2020 probably suffered from Anti Social PD and hate dumb people, I took a sacrifice in pay when I first jumped into the industry for the benefit of my mental health, now the same adults who need their hand held are trying to be my coworkers at all cost.

TL;DR Have to have dedicated time, place, task, and goals.

First, and probably most importantly for me, I have to have a specific workspace that is dedicated to working.  I work 100% remotely as an hardware and software engineer and have been for about 3 years now.  My company provides a laptop and development hardware, but then on top of that, I maintain my own IT infrastructure and host my own ECAD tools.  If I run out of storage space, have a hardware problem that causes me to lose the ability to do anything software related, that's my responsibility.  I'm never going to tell my employer that I wasn't able to accomplish something because of an IT problem.  I converted a portion of my basement storage room to a lab with a hardware workstation so when they send me a $1,000 development board or a piece of hardware, it's got someplace same to live and no cats or children get near it.  When I started working remotely, my sister in law gave me a standing desk (the motorized one that raises and lowers which you can get from Costco) and I absolutely love it.  It's in my office, next to my personal computing workstation, and I have dual monitors that my work machine connects to.  It might be a laptop, but I never leave the house - my remote workstation might as well be an office or cubicle at the main campus with everyone else.  I have a dedicated camera, headset, mouse, everything.  My home office is essentially split into a work side and a light side and those two sides do not mix - I mean that quite literally too; I have two domains on my network named 'light' and 'dark'.

Second, you have to be as consistent, maybe even more so, at having times that you consider yourself working or not working.  How you implement this is up to you - what works for me is to shoot for two Deep Work sessions, where I'm focused and free of distraction, for at least two hours each.  Sometimes, I might try to stretch it to 2.5 hours, and I leave myself the freedom to let it rip if I'm in a good spot.  When I say Deep Work, I'm deliberately channeling Cal Newport and the book he wrote about it.  He summarizes it far better than I can.

I usually start my day with a very quick planning session - I have a spreadsheet with a tab for each day that I populate with a list of tasks that I want to accomplish that day and a table of hours in the day from 4:00 AM to 9:00 PM. And by tasks, I mean tasks that I need to do relative to every aspect of life - kids to day care, pickup, trash out, lifting weights, BJJ, meetings, laundry, and those Deep Work sessions.  I then fill out a notional schedule of what is going to get shoved where in my day.  My goal is to get those two Deep Work sessions done around everything else.  I usually try to get the first one done in the morning before anyone else is even up yet.  When I'm ready to get started, I do a quick check to see if I have any text messages to answer from the night before, turn my phone off and put it in the other room, walk to my work machine, and then start a two hour timer.  Figuring out how to really create these big chunks of time I can be focused is really key and Newport has written extensively about it.

Once I've created those scenarios, it's time to fill them.  I usually start with a specific task that I want to have done at the end of the day or two day period, and then work backwards to create a sequence of smaller things.  Then, I'll work on that exclusively until it's finished or my timer goes off.  If my timer goes off, I'll quickly try to figure if I'm in a good flow state and if so, extend that Deep Work period unless I have a reason I can't (e.g., a meeting that I have to call into or kids are up and have to go make breakfast).  If it isn't, I'm done with Deep Work session #1 and it's time to do whatever the next block of time is allocated for.  Then when the next chunk comes along, I'll do this again.  A big win for me is when I've been able to get two of those Deep Work sessions in during the day, along with everything else.","123"

The next 2 days?""  I constantly go back to that to help recenter myself and not let myself get distracted from what the core thing is.  There are always things that crop up in my brain and one of the things I've found really helpful is keeping a document or a spreadsheet or a text file open that I can just empty my brain out.  As an example, earlier today I was trying to be focused and I got distracted thinking about a new novel from an author I like was in the works and I should go check out what his progress was at.  Rather than break my focus and switch over to [https://www.reddit.com/r/dresdenfiles/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dresdenfiles/) and possibly get lost in fan speculation, I wrote it down in my little notebook, and then got back to what I was working on.  Later in the day, when I'm not doing my Deep Work sessions, I have a list of completely unrelated things to do and I can do them all, free from the knowledge that I'm interfering with my productivity.

That's probably a flavor for what I do - Cal Newport was someone that was really influential in the way I approach knowledge work, so I would recommend you read his book on Deep Work if you want to understand his way of thinking (and what has been, at least for me, wildly helpful).  I'll leave you with a couple of things that you should be aware of that might be helpful

Sleep and nutrition are enormously important at maintaining focus.  Having a consistent time to go to bed and get up cannot be overstated.  Eat good food.  Drink good coffee.  Also, for me, giving up beer was essential.

Need to have other interests and things in your life - otherwise, you'll just stare at your wall, do nothing, and accomplish nothing.  I train BJJ 5 days a week and lift weights every other day and if I want to do those things, I have to be productive during the time I dedicate to the company.

Social exposure is incredibly important.  I didn't realize how much of my social circle was work related until I didn't have it.  Now I get it from folks at my BJJ classes, church, and things in my community.  Also, I schedule time during my week to get together with a friend during the day.  I budget that time into my schedule for the week and I basically shoot for every other week to get breakfast, coffee, or whatever with someone and I just rotate through people that are important to me.  I had burritos this morning with a friend of mine I hadn't seen in three months - but what he doesn't know is that every three months, I make a point to catch up with him, even if it's something simple like that.  And I do that with about a half dozen people so every other week, I've got some sort of social interaction with a friend so that those relationships don't dwindle and die on the vine.  As I get older, it becomes quite apparent to me that friendships falter if we don't maintain them.

Hobbies are similar - I have to be disciplined and schedule time to spend on things that are not work related, or I'll go crazy.  There are days when ""Spend 2 hours in the workshop"" is on my list of things to do that day.

Skill development is one last thing that I'd be remiss if I didn't mention.  One of the things on my list to do during the week and day is to work on a project that is a) work-related and b) entirely focused on skill development.  This is a hard one to nail and not something I would worry about at first.  But eventually, you'll come to realize that you have to make growing your skills deliberately a part of your life or you'll waste huge amounts of time.

Hope this helps.","123_1"

My work day lends itself really well to a couple of deep work sessions, a couple staff or sprint meetings each week, and the bare minimum of checking email. That and a daily jira check in is enough for me to call it a useful and productive day.

The down side to that is that if I don't get those in, it's hard to say when a work day is done or if I actually worked that day. Sometimes when I'm having a hard time staying focused, I need to acknowledge I'm not in the right space to work and then tailor my time accordingly. Maybe go work in the shop, do the dishes or laundry etc. And then try again. It also means that there are days and weeks when I work weekends. Like today. I didn't really accomplish what I needed to yesterday, so I need to get a couple hours in today. Which changed my weekend plans.

The alternative is to just stare or sit at a computer and pretend to be busy, which is what a lot of remote people probably do. I'm very grateful for the freedom I have. And it's my responsibility to do the best I can to deliver regardless of where or when I'm on the job.","123_2_1"

I agree, the tradeoff of flexible/free remote work is sometimes working odd hours to get things done.

It was written in their agreement and now they are using it as a way to force people to move closer or go somewhere else. Its a buyers market, so replacing employees is very easy. Big change from 2022 when it was a complete sellers market and candidates could write their own tickets. Unfortunately for them, most did not understand the implications of their contracts.

Remote work is different from a home based office, in that case, any travel on company time is reimbursed by the company. Again, this is my employer, so YMMV, but we're seeing a lot of similar activity at other companies. We are also actively relocating positions to other call centers in low cost locations, current employees need to reapply for those positions and have two choices, either move and company pays their moving expense, or do remote work and the above applies. A bunch I know chose remote work in the hopes they would not have to go to the office and now are being called in a couple times a month and are deciding if they continue covering their travel or look for something else (in a real crappy job market).

I think that last part will make this supposed LPT flip. 

Is important to note that in the US, employment at will is a thing and you can live 1000 miles away from your office and the employer can try to force you to move closer so you can go to the office if they want, you can be 100% remote for 6 years and then all of a sudden the Executives change their mind and force everyone RTO, that is a risk and people have to either have a plan B if they don't want to RTO or bite the bullet. 

You can also work for an company outside US and they can just lay you off if they want.

Again as with most things in life you make decision based on your risk tolerance. Unless you live in a state that have some kind of law protecting remote workers there is not much you can do.","9"

It can be a challenge. Generally we try and strike a balance but its been a journey. My wifes a teacher and I work corporate. Long hours for both of us, 90 hour weeks for me, 3 hours commute for her. During the school year we barely saw each other. When COVID hit it was a dream. We loved being together. It was like being back in college again. We had to figure out key boundaries since she was teaching and I was working. Both our jobs involve lots of talking but after a little trial and error we found a good balance. Our son was born during the pandemic and was a NICU baby. Once he did come home, he was on oxygen. My wife was still on maternity but I tried to balance working with helping her recover and help with our son who was literally hooked up to a machine right next to my work station that sounded like a jet engine. I changed jobs during this period so it was a stressful time. My wife did what she could to keep things quiet, I moved meetings to try and coincide with quiet times and noise cancelling headphones helped. Nowadays Im still remote but whenever she and the kiddo are off school, the general rule is my office is off limits. She works in a closer district so that helps a lot. Kiddo still likes to come and say hi and I try to keep them informed about my meeting schedule. Ive found that open communication is key but also, having some space is key. One area where we try and balance things is seasonally with childcare. During the school year I take the kiddo to school, watch him when hes sick with exceptions but during the summer my wife takes a larger role. It sounds like you both need to find a way to strike a balance and establish some outlets. See if you can help a little in the mornings before work or see if maybe you can each carve out some time for alone time for your own hobbies. Things should improve once the kids go to school but Ive found the key things are: 
1. Open communication. If something bugs you, be honest, but polite. Try and give her a heads up about key work activities future day. 
2. Balance the work. I get that you bring home the bacon but a little help here and there speaks volumes in terms of respect and gratitude. 
3. Routine. This is REALLY hard with little kids but even the slightest semblance of order can help with stress for both of you. For me, I layout my kids clothes, prepack his snack, and have breakfast basics ready to go the day before. Maybe see if you can prep stuff for meals, its a great way to help. Taking a coffee break? Start a load of laundry. Little things that dont take away from your job but still help. 
4. Time on your own. This is vital for both of you. Friends, hobbies, a walk, whatever. Give yourselves time to decompress. Fresh air works wonders. 
5. Is this the hill you want to die on? In your situation youll have plenty of annoyances. But the key is to take a breath. For example: my son was home sick for nearly two weeks because his lungs are borked so a cold hits him like a train. I had him zombified by a film for my one meeting of the day. Just as my meeting with my boss starts, the film stops, kiddo comes running and starts trying to drag me into the living room to fix it, Im on headphones talking to my boss with a fake background, trying to be professional. I go to give my kid my phone so he can take pictures. Buy myself a little time, nope, it goes haywire, starts blasting opera at full volume and I cant turn it off, I throw it in a desk drawer. During this time my son steals a pen and throw pillow and runs off. Im now trying to keep a professional expression and talk to my boss while my 3 yr old runs around my house with a pen. I wrap up my call, throw the drawn on pillow in the wash, cleanup the car bombs worth of cheerios scattered about my kitchen and go to open a crate of Diet Coke. To top off this misery, I accidentally pierce a can with the scissors and am sprayed full in the face. Total time elapsed, 31 minutes and I was done for the day. My wife comes home and gives me a welcome reprieve for the evening. Life moves on and my son gets to live another day. Youll have stuff like this. Breathe through it and youll be just fine.","3"

Also, another option is for you to do something every time you get up from your desk to help. 

Heading to the bathroom, throw the clothes into the dryer on your way or load up the dishwasher or change a diaper. Only takes 2 minutes, gives you a physical and mental break from work and shows your wife you are in it with her. 

On a call where you dont have to talk or do much, then grab the laundry basket and fold clothes while you attend the meeting with your camera off. 

The little things that get repeated every.single.day is what grinds people down&like a commute wears people out. So, anything you can do during the day to help with those, would be amazing.

And get the kids involved in chores and being independent early. They can fold washcloths and match socks and so on to help pretty early. They can pick up their toys and so on too! 

And keep up the communication with your wife. Part of the frustration is that you get a 100% mental break from the caregiving, but she does not. You even said after work you are 50%, which means she is still at 50% too. She doesnt get the extended 100% mental break.","24_2_1"

Remote work blurs professional and personal life boundaries, creating tension even in the most vital relationships.

A few strategies that might help:

1. **Set Clear Boundaries:** Define and communicate your work hours to your partner and kids. Physical indicators like closing a door or wearing headphones can signal when you're ""at work.""
2. **Decompression Time:** Create a transition ritual, like taking a short walk, meditating, or listening to music, to shift mentally from work to home mode.
3. **Intentional Connection:** Schedule quality time with your partner and kids where you're fully present. Even brief, undivided attention can help balance the ""always around but unavailable"" dynamic.
4. **Alone Time:** Both you and your partner need solo time to recharge. Support each other in carving out those moments.
5. **Frequent Check-Ins:** Have regular, open conversations with your partner about how you feel and where adjustments might help. This ongoing dialogue can reduce friction and deepen understanding.

Youre rightremote work offers terrific benefits but requires intentional effort to adapt to these new dynamics. The fact that youre reflecting and seeking solutions shows youre on the right path.","32"

I was hybrid before covid(even with my office being less than a 10 minute drive) and I enjoyed it immensely.  Full time wfh the last years and I work globally so the time difference is meh.  Luckily I have I have no kids and my wife works(owns a bar/restaurant) so our hours kind of offset.  She does get upset with minor stuff that I could potentially do while wfh but at the same token I'm in meetings or dealing with outages 95% of the day.  It's tough to get a decompress in between.

While I am grateful for the ability to wfh I do somewhat miss the office one or two days a week.  They did shut down my local office so I will not be commuting 2 hours each way to the closest city.  One of the few things that helps for me is she leaves me alone in the morning.  I am not a morning person and my pre wfh routine would be 20-30 minutes in the shower getting ready trying to get my head straight to deal with the shit storm I know I'm walking into for work every morning.  That is now gone.  With no need to actually look like a functional human I can roll out of bed in sweatpants and shirt and have a global meeting within 5 minutes. The wife leaves me alone until about an hour or two into my day.  

Another tip not sure how helpful but my office is still in my basement which is kind of my man cave.  I do not recommend.  Tends to me doing more work when I should just shut the computer off for the day.  Taking the dog for a walk after my day ends is also a big win that just gets me out of staring at a computer screen and clears my head before my to list starts for the evening.","35"

Before the recent bandwagon RTO nonsense, my company had full time WFH for a decade prior to COVID. In fact, when I joined 5 years prior to that, employees for the company were (deliberately, I'm told) spread out in offices across most of the US, concentrated primarily in about 7 major metro areas. 

So even **before** WFH there was a degree of remote teamwork. My team of ~10 (now ~25) was in 4 separate cities (now 6). ""Productivity"" is -- for a lot of roles -- very difficult to measure. But in the 5 years of semi-remote and 10 years of full remote, we have had nothing but the highest feedback grades from our internal customer teams (we don't deal with the public). That kind of ""productivity"" generally will not happen without a LOT of collaboration and teamwork. Requests like ""I'm not up to speed on &lt;technology X&gt;, who can help me get this customer set up using it"" are always answered, despite nobody really having the spare time to. 

In 45 years of IT, I've never been part of a MORE collaborative, cooperative, and team-oriented group than this one. I've also never been at one company more than 4-5 years (stereotypical job hopping) until this one ... and that ""team"" vibe is a big reason.

Sure, maybe my group is the unicorn. The exception which proves the rule. Or maybe it's because it's comprised of adults who are focused on getting the team's shit done, and have been (until now) TREATED like adults, and who don't need to physically LOOK at or DIRECTLY HEAR each other to perform, and perform well. 

The ultimate irony, and giant turd in my corn flakes, is that I am the lone team member in my particular city. So when RTO is fully rolled out I will drive to a fucking office just to interact with my team via Teams, email, and phone calls... **exactly like I do now(*)**. So you'll excuse me if I get worked up over this frankly insulting ""cULtUrE &amp; COlLaBorATIoN"" sputum nearly every company has suddenly decided to embrace at -- purely coincidentally I'm sure -- roughly the same time.  

*-Well, not EXACTLY like I do now. NOW (while still WFH) I think nothing of sticking around an extra 15, 30, or more minutes to finish up some work which would take me at least that long the next morning just to get back to where I stopped. But once I have a commute to worry about? Fuck that. I'm out of here at 5 so my 25 minute commute doesn't take an hour. And I know there are others who will do the same (I suspect MANY others). So, yeah, there's your ""productivity"" gain from RTO. But hey, the important thing is that we LOOK like a picture in a ""come work here"" brochure: several people gathered around someone's monitor, the workstation's owner with hand on mouse, a co-worker pointing out something on the monitor (with keen insight germinated in the fertilizer of collaboration!), and another co-worker taking notes on a notepad; all with appropriate levels of DEI representation, of course.","3_2_1"

Forget that. If you're forcing someone in on Wednesdays no matter what, they should have full discretion to reject *any* Zoom calls that day. And the company had better accept that some work will take a little longer so people can focus on collaborating.

Technology will advance even more by then and the need to be in the same physical location will not have any defense. The cost of running an office where employees are sitting is way too much and productivity is way better working from home vs in the office, with it's burdensome and constant distractions. They just need to figure out how to be able to ensure people who work from home are actually working and not fucking off on their dime. You can throw in keystroke movement technology and cameras on but neither of those will be acceptable by higher producing employees. Those are call center tactics that are just low level anti trust measures. We are in the middle of what companies have experienced and what they strive to be but we will get there one day soon.  The sooner they recognize that the workday/work week itself needs to be flexible, the sooner they will see a higher productivity model. If you cannot figure out who is fucking off then you don't belong in any management position.  I have worked for the past 40 years, 20 of them in house and 20 of them remotely in 2 different industries with many of the same people in both and there is zero doubt that working remotely was way more productive for everyone. I had almost zero turnover on the remote side. When people are able to stop working to feed their family or pick up their kid from school knowing they can go back to work for a few hours in the evening or on weekends, everyone is happier. And by everyone, I am not including the guys in the office who hate not being able to flirt with the women in the office or the boss in the office who gets off sitting behind his big fat desk in his big fat office and calling in staff to pull power moves on them because they get off on that too. I swear I spent a part of everyday trying to mediate disagreements on what the temperature in the office should be because some of the women there would argue it was too cold or too hot.  The only thing I missed not being in the office is for one 5 year position I had we would all go out after work on Fridays and drink and eat and be funny as hell with one another which led to some good moments on Monday when we would remind some of those workers of what a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ they were Friday night.

Another great thing is the low payout threshold. You don't have to wait forever to see your earnings. I've already cashed out twice!

I worked at this warehouse and all I did was shrink wrap furniture and general labor warehouse duties. There were a couple people who were on the computer making labels and deciding the status of the furniture. I was watching what they did and asked how it works. The boss noticed I was interested and surprised how quickly I picked it up. So he put me on the computer more. They were using an old system called AS400. I got pretty good at it. I quit and moved to a different state and worked at another warehouse, all I did was pick orders but I wanted to learn the computer stuff. So they let me do shipping and receiving and then returns. They also used AS400. I moved again and worked as a delivery driver for medical equipment. I had to clean hospital beds and mattresses but also tested their functions and did quality checks. They let me try to do some dispatching and rerouting drivers to make things more efficient for the team. I then left and got a job as a dispatcher for a CDL trucking company. They also used AS400 and this place was insane, 12 hour shifts 6-7 days a week. Made great money, burnt out after 2 years. I hopped around a bit and  got a warehouse supervisor position for an appliance delivery company and learned inventory management, customer manager systems and more. Unfortunately, I kept having to do general warehouse work and unloading trailers by myself because of bad management hiring practices and burning people out. After a year and horrible management, and company support, I walked out. I reworked my resume, emphasised all the technical, management and customer service experience I had. Took me months of applying non stop. I took on temp jobs to pay the bills but I had a dream to work from anywhere so that I can have a better quality of life. I actually landed two online jobs, I did both. One as a dispatcher and other as tech support. I had like 6 hours in between for sleep. I wanted to see which one I was going to stick with. The dispatch job was easy, it was over night and not too much goes on. I taught my wife how to do it and we took off to Mexico lol we both worked. Unfortunately the dispatch job fizzled out, the company went out of business . Anyways, I tried to shorten this up haha.","7_5_1_1"

I documented everything I did for them, so I could remember and speak on it in interviews at new places. 

When I was doing that PM work, our largest client had a PM who had their PMP certification and she gave me a ton of information and helped to cultivate my experience. She later became my reference and helped me land a new role outside that small organization. 

So a lot of hard work and a little luck of finding the right people to support me getting where I wanted to be.

Because I can't afford to leave this house ever again and there's no jobs anywhere near here within walking distance as there are no reliable buses either. Short of suing this town, I mean. So for me looking for ""remote"" is because of my transportation problem because of the town I live in, in the house I grew up in which my parents paid off in full back, oh, about 40 years ago. If I try to move out I'll wind up on the streets or trying desperately to find a Squat to live in and still be LOOKING for a job THAT way, and that's no way to live either.","42_2"

I ended up using my skills and becoming a virtual assistant. I took the time thru trial and error and created my website, social media marketing and kept posting. Connected with small business owners and then started networking thru LinkedIn. I now have 4 clients and its coming like hot cakes.

I used to do B2B sales and it felt good that I didnt have a boss. I was my own boss. I created a pricing formula, researched, created a business plan, reached out to other VAs with more experience and this has really helped boost my self esteem and confidence.

Many free online courses. I used LinkedIn learning and Udemy to get more certifications. Do it! 

I got thru a lot of rejections but you just need a few to say yes and be confident. Increase your skill set. Learn about new program apps, productivity tools and really market yourself. Its hard work and many sleepless nights but Im happy.

Next week, Im signing a contract with a lady who has 4 businesses. And thats going to keep me busy!","76"

Based at home and go out to see customers when I need to. When theres an office meeting I go in. That happens once a quarterish. 

If you are a poor performer management gets on your back, if you do your job theyre quiet. I work on commission, pay my own expenses, I work my own schedule, and have no cap on earnings. 

I tend to get up early, typically work later than my wife likes, work on the weekend if need be, and earn far above average income. When I take a day or half day off without it being a vacation day I feel zero guilt if they find out. They are well aware I put my time in based on my sales performance. If they did bitch, then Id make sure a discussion was had to keep them quiet. But its five and take if your employer knows you work hard. 

If they have a good hunch youre hardly working, youve got a problem. 

My advice: Dont do house chores or look after your children while WORKING from home. Be responsible and do your job when you need to do your job. This is why so many employers want people back at the office.","77"

Only reason I'm telling you this is because I own a software co now and don't do it anymore  
Go on job boards like upwork or even craigslist and find people who need websites  
Once you have a client who needs a website, go to websiteforfree dot com and explain the website to them, they'll make it for free, and just charge $20/mo for hosting, which the client will pay for.  
Charge the client $1000 for the finished product, and can have them pay for the hosting as well.  
P.S. This is what all the big web dev agencies do, just at a bigger scale. The best part is you never really need to talk to anyone on the phone, or meet in person, so it's perfect for introverts :)","11"

I live in MA. I used to work in a call center as a Relay Operator for the deaf &amp; hard of hearing. I type conversational speed &amp; I was also chosen to handle conference calls, which is a challenge but I can type enough accurate info, from 5 different voices&.that the TTY user is comfortable enough for me to jump in, relaying for the TTY user. Im also experienced in other TTY platforms like VCO voice carry over, HCO hearing carry over &amp; Employee Certificates in Deaf Culture, ESL &amp; ASL Training,  I was part of the small group of 5 that opened the center in Holyoke with 4 supervisors who relocated from their jobs in Wisconsin for training, hiring &amp; the termination of perspective operators. 3 weeks of intensive training and accuracy &amp; speed is just as important as typing verbatim &amp; relaying verbatim using the proper tone of voice bec Relay Operators r the ears &amp; the voice of the TTY user only. Ok - thats a little much&. so in a nutshell - I worked 8 hrs &amp; all holidays, OT was always in demand to 10 hr days, go home &amp; come back in 4 hrs to put in 4 more hrs &amp; return for my regular shift. Relay oprs have basically been replaced as computer technology became more efficient &amp; a feeling of normalcy &amp; being independent &amp; self reliant is an enormous boost to the confidence &amp; worthiness to people who had to trust &amp; rely on a 3rd party. F/T, being able to sign, see or communicate personally &amp; privately. TTY oprs r still in existence but I cant find a home office, a name or link to apply. Im on disability myself but to look at me, or socialize with me - I could put on that mask. I just dont know how my body will function or feel on a day to day basis. I would love to work from home, on call, 3rd shift or something like that&. Im just not reliable enough to punch in at set time but I am dependable &amp; capable to work in a capacity that would be ideal for me &amp; the company. I found a Hamilton Relay service hiring for everything &amp; 1 customer service Opr but no link to apply.  Idk anyone who uses a TTY. I even tried calling in but its strictly voice to TTY &amp; I must admit.. the oprs Ive come across follow protocol. I appreciate whoever was bored enough to read my book &amp; any help would be grateful. Happy Friday. #Bless","21"

what happened:


BrandedSurveys  I was making about $150 per month. But last month, I saw that they increased the
numbers of surveys and I made $510. This is the best company for me, guys. They send more surveys if
you work more.


OpinionOutpost  Again, a few months I was making about $100 per month. Last month I decided to
spend more time and I made $315. Not bad. One of my top 3 panels.


MyPoints  I registered last month. $190 till now, but I saw an increase in their offers.


EliteSurveySites  Now, this is my top site. They are not a survey company. They provide a list of the
highest paying survey panels. All of their surveys are tested and legitimate. I fully trust them.


A quick tips of me, guys:


Disclaimer: Im not money making expert!


Register with as many surveys as possible. I gave you details about 3 of them, but I work with over 10
panels. More panels you register means more surveys and more money.


Be honest. Complete your profile survey and all of your surveys honestly.


Dont work only with surveys. There are more making money ways. I personally spend about 1 to 3
hours a day.


Hope that helps.","22"

**1. Employment is not charity**

If you need a plumber, do you go out and look for a homeless guy who ""needs the work,"" or do you look for a licensed plumber with experience, credentials, and references? If you are willing to spend money to get the job done right and on-time, you probably go with option B. 

This is also how businesses look for people to fill jobs. 

**2. Remote jobs have requirements too**

The jobs that are remote tend to be remote because they involve working in front of a computer, teleconferencing, and/or answering phones, which can be done from home. 

Those jobs do require computer and phone skills. They also require a quiet, distraction-free work environment and a reliable internet connection. Depending on the job, you may also be monitored closely and expected to meet minimum performance requirements. 

And you will still probably be expected to be online during certain hours. Even if you're a software engineer, a required 8am meeting is still a required 8am meeting. You still have to be in attendance, even if you're attending remotely.

**3. Supply and demand**

If you're seeking remote work, you are competing against more people for any given job. Because these jobs are not restricted by geography, the employer can select from a larger pool of applicants. Because a lot of people want remote jobs, all but the worst jobs usually get a lot of applicants. 

The good remote jobs tend to be jobs that are good generally. Those jobs are generally good (high pay, benefits, etc.) because demand for people able and willing to do those jobs is greater than supply. 

**4. How to actually find remote jobs**

So if someone is hiring applicants from all over the US, what kind of job would you be among the top applicants for? 

If you can think of one, then just go to Indeed, LinkedIn, Dice, or any of the other major job sites and search for that job. All of the major job sites have an option to search for remote jobs. 

Find a job ad, and research the employer. Use common sense. A remote job application should proceed like any other job application, including a video interview. If something seems sus, it probably is. Don't install apps (other than maybe Skype or Teams for the interview). Don't buy gift cards. Don't send personal financial info until you've been hired and you're filling out a direct deposit form.","5"

The cost of living is not actually as low as wages in my state would have you believe.  

So I get when someone NEEDS a remote job. 

So I had to take an entry level customer service job in a field Id never worked in. One company flat out said no and didnt interview me. Their competitor was like sure. 

The research I did was on their hiring process, growth in the field in my state (great as the state is experiencing unprecedented growth and I sell a needed thing) 

I have kids but I work a 4 day week and im getting childcare for the 3 week days (one is a weekend day and my spouse is home) 

So if someone says I NEED WFH im likely to engage. I do hate when I get downvoted for saying start on the phones and get a foot in the door People think phones are beneath them but TBH its a screener in a lot of fields. Can you handle being monitored? Can you do a good job remote? Yes?
then you could potentially be out of the phones in under a year. 

Reddit was actually very helpful for finding out how to apply and look for remote jobs and also what the interview process was like for the field I had never worked in. 

Tl;dr: I needed a remote job just because It was remote. I had no experience in my new field. It happens. ","14"

There's a reason why startups can outclass and eventually dethrone large corporations. A small group of guys (or gals), working closely together, can move faster and be more efficient than a large, spread out institution with barriers to communication. Now this historically caused by management hierarchies and bureaucracy, but now remote work is contributing. 

There's also a greater lack of accountability I've seen with remote work, at least in my own place of work. When I can go to their cubicle or office and ask for something, the task almost always gets done faster than when I send an email to someone that's WFH. One reason I think is that people feel obligated to someone that's proximal to them, that is nearby versus a request asked by someone far away. 

and sadly, remote work seems to also attract the ""slacker"" types, which end up slowing everyone else down. when you're a startup or have a product deliverable, everybody's contribution counts, and you sometimes move at the speed of the slowest person","4_1_1_1_1_1"

The productivity in remote work, with the right people is way higher than in office.  The amount of every day bullshit one has to tolerate in an office takes up about 30%+ time. People see other people, they talk about non work stuff, they bitch and gossip about non work stuff every day over and over again. The meetings held by upper management in the office wastes a shit ton of time.  I managed staff using Slack and we are talking every day on there, but it is always work related and, in many cases, instead of just being one on one convo's about work related stuff I am able to bring in others who can also benefit from the very brief training and new processes that arise.  I have never given 2 shits about whether or not someone had to duck out for a half hour or more to get something done that was personal as long as their work was being done and with remote work, a lot of it could also be done in the evenings and weekends so I actually saw staff jump back into their roles on non routine hours. I had almost no turnover of staff during the remote time compared to in office.  People were happier in general being able to work from home. We had some social events scheduled that they could attend or not if they felt like being around their co workers for a drink or a meal outside of work.  I cannot tell you the amount of time upper management wasted our time in office just because they saw my face or my office door open. That did not happen remotely.","9"

If you can do the job without being part of a larger collective in some large office building that's a win..

It's a win for the employer and the employee. If the employer was smart, they would re negotiate their leases for less Sq footage and save. The employee saves on gas, maintenance on vehicles, potential child or elder care expenses. In the end  it's a huge benefit for the employee. HOWEVER...for the great benefit provided, the employee needs to provide some value for the money they are now saving. 

1. If your work day is 7 to 3 or whatever, don't expect to do anything else that you couldn't do if you were in an office. Give the employer just what is required. Stay at your desk at home without all the things that seem to pull people away from their productivity ( errands shopping etc). If you couldn't do it while in the office, can't do it while WFH.

2. Since the commutes and daily grind of all that goes with it is no longer an issue,  you just got a significant increase in expendable income.

3. Because most people can't be trusted to WFH without being distracted  by anything shiny, you need to be monitored for activity. If you are WORKING..that should have no impact on you.

At this time, we know we will never return to a 5 day work week but not sure if they will attempt the hybrid model again.

That being said, if/when they do implement the hybrid model - I may start looking as well. Life is too short to hate your job. I worked remote before the pandemic so it's always been my preferred type of work. And the pandemic created SO MANY remote jobs!!! Perhaps you could give them opportunity to keep you. If you get an offer with another company, before you accept the offer you could let your current company know your plans and give them the opportunity to keep you as a fully remote person. If they can't meet that requirement, then leave and don't feel bad - you gave them a chance before leaving for greener pastures.

I've only worked remote for this company during the time I've been there because of the pandemic. Commuting sucks, I'm more productive at home and I don't like the location of the company's physical building. The office is in a dangerous part of the  city. One of the mass shootings in the news this year was very very very very very very close to the building. I can't see myself feeling comfortable working in this area until 5:00pm or later, since we regularly work 10-12 hour days from home. Quite honestly, I get much more done than when I work from home. I have fun in the office when everyone is there for sure but I am SO less productive! And not to mention - it is so much more exhausting! LOL

I go to the office on an as-needed basis, like a couple times a month. I pick my days to go in based on my work load and I leave whenever I feel like it (I dont stay a full 8 hours and will resume working once I'm home). I often run to/from my car to the front door of the office when I go in. I've already been followed to my car by a sketchy crackhead (whom proceeded to knock on my window and wave at me after I jumped in my car to get away from him) and dodged drug dealers and mentally ill people pissing on the sidewalk in front of our exit door. Yes, one day I was about to fling open the exit door and run to my car like usual and I see someones ass. A homeless drug addict had decided to back their butt up to our exit door and do their business. Literally, I had to wait for them to finish and pull up their pants before I could open the exit door, and leap over their puddle of piss before I did my normal anxiety jog/fear speedwalk to my car.

I'm fine with visiting the office as-needed once a week/couple times of month and special events but anything more than that will make me bounce for sure.","12"

Corporate America needs to wake up. The pandemic gave us something we didn't have before :FLEXIBILITY. Its frustrating that so many employees fell in line when they were told to go back. So it's up to us, especially those of us w young kids whos school day ends @3, to change the status quo.

It's easier to find a job while you still have one and you can negotiate more aggressively because you have the option of simply walking away if they aren't amenable to your terms.   


I genuinely hope the companies pulling this crap go bankrupt from their workforce leaving and having a domino effect.

Knowing that one day my employer might want me to work in an office - I made sure I carried myself well over the years. I was always friendly, likeable, outgoing, willing to travel to various offices for projects and collaboration.

I rarely if ever complained. 

And when they thought they were cute and make me work in a satellite office with people unrelated to my job, i launched my push back with precision. 

I 1) actually did go into the office and 2) expressed to my COO that it's made me deeply resent my company 3) let every manager I've developed a good relationship with know that I'm looking for a new job. 

Eventually item 3 made it's way to my COO who was shocked I was looking for a new company (and possibly a competitor) - shocked because I never complain (except during item 1). I let others spell out to our leadership what it would mean to lose me, the hypocrisy of making me go into an office when we are a national service company with lots of back office workers no where near an office. 

In the end, I got a personal exception. 

This is critical: you sincerely thank your company leadership for the exception, you deliver something awesome in the next week to remind your leadership that it was a good choice to keep you happy, and you NEVER EVER let office people know you're working from home or how you got an exception.

Once you get the PIP, you will see that there are no objective measures of performance and vague, subjective goals. 

How do I know this? Exactly this happened to me last month.

Edit: It was my manager and my skip-level manager who wanted me gone, so there was no reasoning or defending. If you smell fish, trust your instincts and just look for a job. If you get a PIP, dont make the mistake I did and raise a formal grievance. Otherwise, you wont be able to take them to court for constructive dismissal (my advice is UK based).

Edit 2: I wanted to clarify that my mistake was not to raise a formal grievance as soon as I received the PIP. When I spoke with my lawyer after the 1 month PIP was over and I got laid off, he said I was not in a strong position to take them to court.","8"

So, basically, you would want to look for different treatment or cues from your boss (and up the chain of command) and HR in case you work with them.

Your coworkers, project managers, etc. will not know in advance, so don't parse their words or actions, you'll probably just make yourself paranoid.

FWIW, I've been laid off twice and had zero indication that I was on the list.

ETA: Timing - usually lists are put together a week or two before. That's when they know final budget numbers and how many people they'll need to lay off.

I went fully remote last year when I moved and the company started bringing in new policy around employees first being hybrid then it went full office but there was still a handful of people remote on remote contracts.

We went from around 18 remote workers to 1 from December 2023 to August 2024. 

It was evident that from January this year they started to not engage with me as much, restructured departments and made my team less involved. 

The signs were subtle over time and they denied when I was laid off that remote work was a reason but it clearly was and they couldnt admit it due to my remote contract being in place. 

If you have the feeling it may happen hold onto that as it is highly likely it will happen. I was a high performer as a senior member and lead of my team and I was still sacrificed so unfortunately performance doesnt always save you.

If the company has any plans to reduce remote work then your time at the company is on countdown as its a matter of time. They cant legally force you out so they will just reduce your engagement etc until you leave or they find a way to lay you off. 

Probably not the news you want but its reality in tech these days as companies dont care.","22"

from a very restrictive diet, to standing desk conversions, to using my lunch break to sit out in the sun without a shirt on to up my VitD levels,  weird usage of various therapy devices for my back or feed that i would never feel comfortable using around people,  

my day to day existence is so incredibly.... particular, high-needs, and just .. impossible for me to up and take with me anywhere and 100% geared to ensuring my health, at the very least, doesn't get worse....

i simply couldn't take my lifestyle with me to the office.

from the eye drops, to the supplements, to the ice packs and TENS units and heating pads to fresh cooked lunches to having ""physical therapy snacks"" every hour or so... 

just no way.. i can't exist outside of my home at this point.

But because quite literally 30+ doctors can't give me a diagnosis for anything definitive and i only have a handful of markers showing SOMETHING is going on (serum IgA indicates cancer, autoimmune or persistent infection of some kind) but no one knows what exactly. .. i don't know if i even qualify for some ""disability"" category.

While I can technically work in an office, I can work so much better at home.

A good example is that I get migraines with aura. When one hits, I lose my vision for 45-60 minutes, and need to lie down with my eyes closed during that time.

When that would happen to me at work, Id have to go home. Luckily I live in a city with public transit, so can make it back home on the subway with limited vision.

But if I cannot lie down right away, it makes it more likely I will have a bad headache that lasts a long time. Id often have to take off the entire day of work.

If Im working at home and a migraine aura hits, I can lie down for less than an hour, and usually be back working immediately after. 

There are so many other things like this for me. I used to max out my sick days  maybe 8-10 per year at least.

For starters, it eliminates the daily commute, which not only saves time but also reduces stress and exposure to pollution. This extra time can be invested in physical activities or preparing healthier meals at home. Additionally, remote work allows for a more flexible schedule, enabling individuals to work during their peak productivity hours, which can lead to a better work-life balance.

At OWOW, we've noticed that remote work fosters an environment where employees feel trusted and valued, leading to higher job satisfaction and reduced turnover rates. It's not just about physical health; the mental and emotional aspects are equally improved, contributing to overall well-being.

Add in, remote workers seem to be in more meetings/breakout sessions/harder to gain access for a quick meeting an in person groups can do on the fly.  Went back to Hybrid/Travel and our projects for clients started to keep to complete projects faster.

Now, my company did keep a few WFH positions open.  Mostly internal business needs and tech writers.  But some of those positions will be eliminated with next wave of RPA/AI projects we are rolling out next year.","16"

I now practice being aware of my own emotions - and choose when to express them *in the moment* versus keeping them inside/in my head/gaslighting myself where they could loop. 

I also spend more time with the people I love the most (family - I dont have any friends, big surprise). Anything in moderation is ok.

I work in an open office with zero walls that averages around 70dB at any time of day. Lunch that jumps up to like 80dB.

I refuse to adhere to policies that are demonstratably bullshit. Not a single one of these morons look at open office studies or RTO studies before they make these decisions, they just do them.

The hospital would reimburse her for mileage as part of her compensation package. Except she didn't really go home between the shifts - she rented a room from this elderly lady for $25 a night and some light house keeping. At the time I think the federal reimbursement for mileage was around .50 a mile so each week she would bill the hospital for $270 in miles.

Yes: If you mean the middle of the US for a US company. Yes, you won't see SV salaries. But you also won't be able to recruit the same SV level talent. 

If you mean lower salaries as in non-US, there is a lot of taxes, extra logistics, labor force, time loss in timezone management, and currency volatility that makes that not such of a good appearance. Most of the Indian label is managed via companies on the Indian side, after the overhead they tend to produce crap work, culture fit issues, work that leads to other work, go overtime, etc. 

No

In the US a remote worker is paying for their own place, their on furniture, electricity, building security, network (even if it's subsidied), and even are their onsite support. Adding one more employee is no extra overhead cost. Very minimal on the HR side.","6_1_1_1_1"

Dont get me wrong, I think you have the ability to analyze the job, analyze the policy, analyze the personal costs based on their current definitions but those definitions are not carved in stone.

Look at that offer in the big picture. There might be something there that is interesting. Could this opportunity as is put you in a position to gain experience to where you could get a better remote job in the future.

You will be doing yourself a favor as well as everyone else here.  Give your hiring manager an opportunity to go to their manager and argue that they are losing good candidates because of RTO policy.

Also, you moving around without telling them puts you and them at tax risk. 

Say you work in CA and you support a customer in NY. If you travel to NY to work more than 45 day in a year, you have to pay taxes for CA for the time in CA and NY for the time there. (AFAIK NY has one of the lowest limits, most places its like 90 days you have to work there before your required to pay taxes. )

So by you moving around, if you were in any state longer than their threshold you would owe taxes in that state.

Depending on how long you are working in another state you may need to pay taxes in that state.

As for why WFH is not popular?
Billionaires own tech companies and diversify their wealth (old school trick) by owning both the office buildings and the housing units, often inside of REITs. WFH means empty apartments means lower rents means lower ROI which also means lower resale value. Empty office buildings means building values being slowly eroded on that front too, as growth stalls. Further, businesses around the building are owned by multi-millionaires and billionaires, such as chain restaurants and preschools/daycares. Their profits drop as well.

- Hybrid seems to be stabilizing at 3 in, 2 wfh
- fully remote is staying, but opportunities are more limited to timezone / geographical area around the office. 
- HR compliance with state tax / employment laws is ironclad, and not all states may be supported by a company
- companies / teams are working through how to mix remote and on-premise coworkers, either in same team or within same organization. Unlike during COVID when everyone was forced into remote there is now a big mix of how people can work, and where preferences lie.

Remote is never going to be as widespread as 2020-2021, but it probably wont stabilize for sure for a couple more years until hybrid can be fully evaluated, and full RTO at extremely large tech companies completes (succeeds or fails)

If I was in an org that is hasnt gone hybrid, or talked about it by now, Id feel like its stable, but that can also change if it gets bought out, goes under, or has a key leadership change in the board / C-suite

With the new year starting, seeing what kinds of companies are hiring, for what roles, and what theyre open to should give us all more insight","16"

The paradigm shift is already happening as many young employees were hired fully remote since 2020. This young workforce considers ""normal"" to work from anywhere and won't apply for in-office presence type of jobs.

Employers are already facing that fact combined with fewer candidates than ever.

Companies working fully remote since 2020 are now budgeting less travel cost from their employees and also less cost for their office space leases. 

This is a major reason why you should move where you want to live and not where you want to work.

If they are paying you more to take on more work and it's still not worth it for you, then quit. If they aren't paying you more to do more work, then that's setting the clear expectation that you should not be spending any more time than you were already. So, don't stress about it. If you aren't getting things done, that's their fault, not yours. Just do things at the same rate you always have and don't stress it. They don't have a leg to stand on to pull you in and talk about performance when they are the ones asking you to do a bunch of extra stuff that they don't want to pay you for and is not in your job description. If they want you to help with this or that, it's fine. But it's with the clear understanding that's taking time away from your main role and you won't be getting that done on time. That's for them to figure out and manage, not you. If your manager is mismanaging you as a resource, that just reflects poorly on them and not you.

You can try to get a new offer somewhere else, and then ask your current employer whether they would like you to stay as a remote worker or leave.

Thats assuming that you would want to stay. This current job sounds like a poor work environment due to that managers general inability to manage, and a culture that allows that to go on for an extended time. 

Some people have pointed out that the job market isnt doing well at the moment, but it seems to be dependent on industry. Some industries are laying off left and right, while others are still desperate for skilled people. I hope that youre in the latter, or at least in an industry thats functioning normally at the moment.

Good luck to you. Most workplaces are staffed with fairly decent, mostly competent people, and you should definitely be able to find a new workplace that treats you with respect. And in turn, that will reduce the amount of stress in your life. This current situation sounds pretty stressful.","11"

Sounds to me like since youre contract only states that you have to have A telecommute contract that they will be able to sub the new one in with the old one and the new one will probably be some hybrid bullshit like 1 day remote with a clause that states it can be changed at anytime with the plan to full RTO after a quarter or two

Your best choice is to probably just find a new job and let you boss know that youre looking and see what happens. If you cant afford to be let go and draw unemployment then definitely dont tell your boss because theres a good chance theyll just let you go unless youre a top producer.

Hi \[Manager's Name\],

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base regarding the status of my telework contract. As you know, when I was hired in November 2023, I was informed that the position would transition to a telecommuting role after completing 12 weeks of in-person training. While there were some delays in starting and completing the training, I finally transitioned to working from home around the 9-month mark.

As of now, its been about two months since I began telecommuting, but my contract still hasnt been fully signed off. During our previous discussions, you mentioned that the contract would be finalized soon, but Ive since learned that telework contracts are currently ""on hold"" as the company works out a new policy.

I understand that policy changes can take time, but Im concerned about the uncertainty surrounding my telework arrangement, especially given the recent communication that those without signed contracts may be required to return to the office. Ive been assured that my situation will be resolved, and Ive continued to give my best effort remotely, but I would appreciate further clarity on the timeline or any next steps I should be aware of.

Thank you for your support and any additional information you can provide. I just want to ensure that everything is aligned and avoid any surprises moving forward.

Best regards,  
\[Your Name\]","4"

It is also possible to solve through legislation; simply mandate that remote employees must be paid the same as on-site employees. The specific method of accomplishing equal pay is debatable; there are obviously loopholes that must be closed, but it is not an insurmountable issue.

As for productivity, nobody is advocating for all jobs to become remote, as that isn't even possible to begin with due to many jobs requiring an on-site presence, but also due to the fact that nobody is forcing companies to go remote. It is simply what a growing number of employees desire, and the market will simply have to adapt. If some employees wish to work on-site, they are free to do so. An increase in remote workforce even helps companies in this regard, as they can pay less for a smaller office space!

As humans we are social beings , but we dont need to do that at work. The shift here is that remote work allows people to finally decouple from work in a way a majority havent been able to do prior.  What we are seeing is that people have been so accustomed to getting that social interaction from work, that they are a bit lost when they have the freedom to get it from anywhere. IMO people and cities will adjust because the pros outweigh the cons for both business and personal but it will take a while.","20_3"

In a given week, people that are top tier put in around 50 hours a week. Figure 7 hours of sleep a night, that's \~42% of their waking time spent working for a given week. Not scrolling, not looking at the clock, but actual work work vs ""at work,"" That's a lot of time to not socially interact and be starting at a screen.

They don't have the freedom to get social interaction anywhere, because for 42% of the time their interaction avenues are limited to those through work. So they save some time on a commute - which in a metropolitan area enables human interaction. A daily poker game on heavy rail, for example, or the ""bar car."" Given the increasing urban density of those areas, that also happens to be places where more and more people live.

It was the internet that enabled remote work for most white collar jobs - specifically email versus the (mimeographed) memo. So the rise of the internet was synonymous with the rise of remote work.

I'm a consultant, so I used to either fly to customer sites every couple of weeks or work out of my house when I wasn't flying. Still got plenty of customer interaction and interaction with other humans. When covid hit, everyone went to remote work full time - 0 human interaction for 50 hours a week live. And frequently longer periods than that. 

Now, clients have realized that they save tons of money not paying expenses, so have everyone stay home all the time for about 75% of the prior value delivered when they had us on site - a net surface win for them. But with the inevitable downside of seeing people not as people, but as dancing screen images or not even that when 70% of the attendees don't turn their camera on.

Our clients are realizing their inability to effectively interact with their customers due to the socialization issues with Covid are impacting their top and bottom lines, aside from the impact on their health care costs. So they are starting to RTO for those reasons. However, since we charge for travel costs, we're still mostly remote.","20_4_1"

The facts dont lie. 

People are more productive at home. Employees are happier. It allows people to live in lower cost areas. Employers have a much larger pool of candidates and can negotiate lower salaries as a result. Startups with a remote workforce can perform better than businesses with an on-site model.

While employers are hoping to force the issue, it simply wont work  unless they are willing to pay the difference. They will need to raise wages $9 an hour for the commute, and $14k a year for daycare. 

If employers really want to return to office, they need to reevaluate what a living wage means and adjust their salaries accordingly.

Its not an issue of employees being difficult or stubborn  its that many cant afford to return to office. Its not about convincing them with stupid propaganda like this.

No one with small children can afford an on-site office job and it doesnt matter how much you strong arm them. A $17 an hour job needs to pay $23 *just for childcare costs alone.* 

So when they try that shit, employees will quit because they cant afford the job. No one is going to work themselves into being homeless to stroke some executives need to have power and control.

The answer is simple  either pay much higher wages ($15 an hour more if someone has children and commutes) or shut up about it. 

These assholes are literally expecting their employees to work some sort of miracle. Employees dont set the rental rates. Employees dont determine gas prices. The only people with the power to influence this situation are the employers.

All the bitching and moaning isnt going to change the fact that **workers cant afford to go into the office.** Until they address that, the conversation is over.","1"

Now it's just merely good but still definitely better than going to the office which was soul sucking.
What dropped it from awesome to merely good is now my company isn't respecting my time.  Last year they did away with timesheets because they said your output, project delivery and interactions with your team and manager were enough and there's no need to force us to do extra admin work.  A lot of us cheered.  Who wants to sit down once a week trying to recall how much time they spent on a project?

Anyways we didn't realize this was just a trap. After that they eliminated contractors.  Uh uh... who's going to do the work the contractors were doing.  Those contractors weren't just sitting at their desk twiddling their thumbs.  After that new urgent projects that had to be completed in 30 days started popping up from whoever is sitting in the C suite with no idea how long these projects actually takes.  Long story short multiple people went from working 40 hours/week during slow time and 50 hours/week during big projects to consistently working 60-80 hours/week.  It's insane right now really.  The only thing saving my sanity is I don't have to drive 2.5 hours round trip every workday and I can step away most any time of the day for 30 min to 1 hour.  

But I came to the conclusion the company knew what they were doing.  Even as salaried employees they know it's insane to expect a 60-80hr work week as the norm and now they've erased an easy paper trail for those who want to complain.  You can still track your time yourself and complain but it makes it harder without an official company tracking system.","1_1_1"

Now, you'll see a lot of article is WSJ, Forbes et al. about how work from home is dead because big companies have huge lease on massive amounts of real estate and they're desperate to get people back into those offices. Additionally, WFH is proving that significant amounts of middle managers are useless and those folks would love to have you back in an office where they can play boss and keep their jobs. 

I think what will emerge is that Apple, Google and places with big enough bureaucracies and reputations can force folks to RTO.

Most are located in cities all over the globe.

This will affect the local tax revenue.  It will also likely cause a few banks to fail. 

RTO mandates shift the burden of propping up the economy to middle class workers (at the detriment of the environment) rather than allowing investors to take a hit and requiring governments to shift their tax revenue and let go of building spaces. It prolongs the inevitable market correction creating a false economy and Its happening everywhere.

I, too, am baffled.  **What's the real driver behind RTO?**

**Productivity?** Those of us who've worked the work, pulled nights and weekends and brought the laptop on vacation know this is not true.

In a proper WFH setup,  I found coworkers at home more available, more willing to put in extra hours to get a problem solved, and easier to communicate with in than the sad folks hunting for a seat in the awful prison cafeteria arrangements so currently in vogue and so bad they make us miss cubicles.

Long time WFHs knew this already, but COVID validated it for a much bigger audience.  The stream of healthy corporate results during WFH wouldat long lastquiet the naysayers and doubters.

Or so we thought.  Then executives abruptly shifted to inane explanations anchored by ""feel"" and not data, sometimes mere weeks after praising the work we had been doing just fine from home.

No one really believes moving *the exact same job that's 100% on phone/on screen* to an office helps productivity, and that includes senior leaders who 18 months ago were saying ""don't care where, just get the work done.""  It's a diversion.  But why?

**Cost reduction?**  Originally, I thought my former employer was forcing RTO to control labor costs by creating ""constructive dismissal"", the legal term for turning a work environment so hostile and toxic that employees just leave on their own.  I can't confirm this objectively, but then leadership at times seemed surprised by the numbers who were actually taking severance and actually leaving.  Did they really think we would actually pay to move ourselves and families 1000 miles?

In any case, since when have these companies been bashful about slashing costs through layoffs?  Why are they bothering with all the bad publicity. a demoralized workforce, and a damaged reputation from RTO when they can (and) do riff people quietly?

And why are so many companies doing this at exactly the same time?

**There must be a bigger reason.**  I know this borders on lunatic conspiracist, but here goes. Two suspicions:

**Real estate.**  RTO initiatives are coming from businesses with existing holdings or leases in real estate.  The people who own the buildings are *desperate* to get people back on premises.   Municipal leaders are terrified over the potential loss of their tax base.  Even the Federal Government has mandated RTO, but at least they're honest about the reason: to get people back on the metro and into the downtown. (The edict is system wide and unfortunate for those not in DC now being called into hastily assembled trailer offices in low-rent office parks)

CEOs recognized the effects of WFH on commercial real estate early on.  Most of us expected WFH would yield enormous savings as the burden of providing a workplace shifted to employees, the majority of whom would gladly set up a home office in exchange for getting back the time and expense of commuting.  Companies would jump at the opportunity to unload expensive, empty square footage.

We were wrong about that.  The COVID shutdown wasn't one company in a single industry deciding to go full remote, it was the entire tenant base of every office building in every city, gone. This matters because the same banks relying on commercial mortgages not to default are the same banks that underwrite corporate debt.

In the realm of corporate boards, there's a lot of crossover between companies and industries.  These folks socialize in the same exclusive country clubs, fly on each other's jets, sit on each other's boards.   I'd bet that many of these CEOs are personally invested in commercial real estate, because that's a thing one does with outrageously excessive compensation. The WFH quash might well have started in these board rooms (*poor Monte here is having a really tough quarter, guys*) mere days into the shutdown.

To avoid the perception (and reality and liability) of putting their own employees at grave risk, they would need to wait for the all-clear on COVID. When that came, the jig was up.  WFH was over.

None of them could possibly give the real reasons""*we're disrupting the lives of tens of thousands of workers to preserve the value of our land baron investments.""*  Instead, employees and the public got vague, indefensible, and insulting nonsense about productivity, collaboration, and cost.

As conspiratorial as this sounds, it makes more sense than the ""productivity"" pablum coming from company leaders.

**Herd Instinct**  Maybe I'm overthinking it (*ya think?).*  CEOs fancy themselves as innovators, and occasionally one actually is (Steve Jobs, for example).  But most are just trying to maximize shareholder value.  They have a well-known history of copycat moves.  (GE made it their business model).  It happened with open offices, when Microsoft NT displaced Novell, it's going on right now with cloud (and in these companies, Microsoft Azure in particular).  A couple of influentials like Jamie Dimon decide they want people back in the office, and the rest of the pack follows.

**None of these are fully satisfactory answers.** I'm still baffled.","12"

1. Library - I have a rotation of 5 libraries I go to.  The bonus part besides the books is that I can print stuff for free
2. I try to do a yoga class twice a week, but sometimes work gets busy and I miss it, in that case I'll go to the gym.
3. I do a non-work related online class a few times a week during the day (for me it's a DJ online school)
4. I did a few salsa classes during the work day, however those classes got canceled, now I do it at night.  Find a day time class that you can sneak out to.
5. Work at relatives houses (mom's, sister when I'm in town).
6. I cleaned the balcony this past weekend and I'm going to spruce it up with some nice fake wood tiling, some chairs and table
7. I've worked in Mexico for a couple of weeks along with Bend, Oregon.  I would have stayed longer but my girlfriend wanted me back LOL
8. Very rarely, I'll have lunch with non-work related friends.

Here are some things you can do to improve your mental health:

1. The biggest fact for your mental health is having a strong network of friends and family and make sure it's being around them in person...not through text, social media, zoom.  All that artificial stuff is not the same as being there in person.
2. If you use social media, make sure you engage with people on it (like, comment) and not just scroll through on it.  Engaging with others on social media, although super artificial, improves your mood vs. just doom scrolling.
3. Make sure you get plenty of sunlight, ideally first thing in the morning.  This improves your sleep and your overall well being.
4. Get some exercise during the day.  Exercise has been shown to be one of the biggest factors in warding off depression.
5. Incorporate an interest or hobby in your day.  For me, it's reading books and music, so yeah, I love going to the library, love doing my online DJ school during the day and going to salsa classes at night.
6. Look for social happy hours for your area.  There's a social happy hour IG group for my neighborhood that I'm always wanting to go but always miss out on it.  There was a walking group in my neighborhood on NextDoor before it got too hot.","21"

Sounds like you are on track to do well in the WFH environment!

It'll make it look like the first public IP address from your machine is actually from your old house.

That said, I would suspect that the reason you can't move is because you want to move out of state.  150 miles could put you in Michigan, West Virginia, or Pennsylvania.  That would require your company to establish a presence in that state, set up a tax system, your HR department would have to check the state's employment laws and modify any policies that may violate specific laws in that state.  It isn't a trivial amount of work, but it isn't huge either.  My current company does that for us and they don't have a huge HR department for anyone that moves to a state they currently don't have a presence in.  If it is a 1 or 2 person HR department that isn't using software that is currently set up to handle multiple states, this would be a fairly large ask.  Also, your company would be contributing taxes to Ohio, and none to the actual state you live in.  Claiming you actually live in Ohio at tax time would be criminal, and not claiming you still live in Ohio could very well tip off your employer.  Also.. car insurance fraud if you claim you live somewhere you don't.  You can dig yourself into a pretty big hole really quick.

If it is the city itself, that's probably a tax incentive they have with the city, and there probably isn't a lot of wiggle room unless the company is willing to forgo the free money.

Perhaps it is just better to find another job that does not have those requirements?","5"

What Is Local Tax? States with Local Income Taxes in 2024

ü

Gabrielle Sinacola|Aug 11, 2023

Business tax planning can be complicated. Its particularly involved for employers with multi-state payroll, who need to figure out withholding obligations in every state where they employ workers.

If you do business or employ workers in one of the 15 states that allow local jurisdictions to impose income taxes, you might also need to withhold and remit local income taxes where your employees live, work, or both.

What is local income tax?

Local income tax is a type of income tax levied by a local tax jurisdiction, such as a town, city, county, or school district.

Local income tax rates are frequently lower than federal or state income tax rates. Proceeds fund public services, programming, and infrastructure in the taxing jurisdiction, including the following project types:

Parks

Libraries

Police departments

Fire departments

Education systems

Public healthcare systems

Garbage collection services

Road maintenance and repair

Types of local taxes

There are multiple types of local taxes. Heres an overview.

County. Individual counties can also impose income taxes. As an example, all 92 counties in Indiana impose local income taxes at rates between 1% and 2.864% of earned income.

City. Income tax imposed by a city is known as city income taxes. As an example, New York City income taxes vary from 3.078% to 3.876%.

School district. School district taxes fund public educational systems in a particular jurisdiction. As an example, Ohio allows school districts to impose local income taxes with public approval. This tax applies only to residents, not to individuals who work in the jurisdiction. As of 2024, 210 school districts in Ohio impose an income tax.

Do you pay local income tax where you live or work?

Local income tax is usually based on where a taxpayer lives, but in some cases, taxpayers also owe local income tax based on where they perform work (for example, if they commute). You may have withholding obligations based on where your company does business or based on where your employees perform work. Consult your business tax professional for guidance based on your companys specific situation.

Here are two state-specific examples.

Ohio

Ohio requires employers to withhold local income taxes in the jurisdiction where work is performed and allows employers to also withhold local income taxes in the jurisdiction of employee residence at the employees request. In many cases, employees can apply a credit for local income taxes paid to the work location jurisdiction, to reduce the amount of tax due to the jurisdiction of residence. If an employees resident school district imposes a school district tax, the employee may owe those taxes as well.

As an example, Columbus applies a local income tax rate of 2.5%, and Phillipsburg applies a local income tax rate of 1.5%. If you have an employee who lives in Columbus and works in Phillipsburg, the following requirements may apply:

The company withholds local income taxes in Phillipsburg at a rate of 1.5%

The employee owes taxes in Columbus at the higher rate of 2.5%

Columbus allows a 100% credit for taxes paid to another jurisdiction, so the employees net obligation to the City of Columbus would be 1% of earned income

The employees total liability to both jurisdictions is 2.5%

In this scenario, your employee might request that you withhold the additional 1% from their paycheck or pay the remainder themselves as part of their annual tax return.","14_1_1_1_2_2"

Ive been in the medical field since 2009. I wish we had stuff like this when I started because my family had no idea what I did when I went off to work. The title HR has always thrown me off. I also was never privileged to have what I consider an HR person
that I can brag about. The one time I went to one I realized this certain one listened to me to make sure the company was okay and her position stayed solid. Am in my forties and I still dont know who to turn to when there is an issue in the office. I also live in a no fault state so you could literally do everything and be let go because you told a story that was world wide known. Now because of the contents of that story you cant even imagine what they wrote about me on why I was let go. I knew then no one looks out for the person that needs the job the most. People say money dose not make you happy but it can make people hear your side of the story but they have the money and I dont. I have to live knowing somewhere there is a paper that they sat down and tried to really defamed my name when really they could have just said my position wasnt available anymore? Truly that baffles me, why be that cruel, take things to next level just because you can, we need more people with good morals in the higher places. Its not enough to be the one with the money you also have to keep your foot on the necks of the ones who dont.  I had never been pulled in the office, no write ups, but also I didnt get a 3 month review or any reviews and I absolutely loved working there. The second place I can say I loved waking up and going to work and I wanted to stay so I would email, text, ask should I be getting a review. I would ask how can I be better, am I doing a good job. Even when I saw the shift happening I never gave up. Yes sometimes I cried in the bathroom because it got lonely seeing I was not moving forward or backwards. Then I told a co-worker a story about a kindergarten teacher whos married to a cop what they were on trail for and a week later I was brought in and was told I made her uncomfortable then boom life change. Nothing I did there made any of them to think she deserve more. So am sorry your going through this and the only advice I have is to keep fighting. Cause am still trying to find my place. I thought you learn a craft and you realize no matter what you know you can always teach you more, be honest, respect people time by always being on time, stop time for time for little gestures to make someone smile you dont what people are going through, never be to good enough to take out the trash, always say yes when someone needs help, even with little money stay groomed, keep the office the office leave home at home, and I always tried to think about my team because they were the ones who had to pick up my slack and at the end of the day I still feel like I know nothing. Money rules the world and no matter how much the higher ups say equal this equal that & NOPE.. I have no clue why they dont pick the ones that try the hardest from elementary on its a popularity game. ","42"

AFAIK it's not possible esp if you dont have admin rights &amp; if the network settings are locked to admins only - internally they'll know where you're logging in from. VPNs are used to protect outsiders from seeing your connections/protecting your connections, not internal...so your IT dept would know. Now whether or not they *care* is another thing altogether. Most, if not all companies, have the ability to see all of this data but only a few of them actually care to check it. 

If you work for a really intense company, it's grounds for termination. Its ground for termination regardless - as youve stated youre remote but have to remain within a certain area; but thats up to you if you wanna risk it. Theres also the chance that they wont monitor or care.","43"

Your IT department will know youre using a VPN, but however they try to check the location will show as your exit location.

Get a router that supports VPN (with kill switch), and have your entire home WiFi permanently connect to the VPN. 

If they ever ask why you use a VPN, just say that its for security and privacy reasons and your entire home network always operates on one.

Btw, you can reduce the chances of them finding out youre using a VPN if you pay your VPN for a dedicated IP address (one just for you). This IP is unlikely to be flagged as a VPN address as it would have never been seen used by other VPN users.

Im speaking from experience: I worked from Brazil for 3 months for a highly secure fintech company that keeps a close eye on these things and didnt allow work outside the US. Their policy was to terminate people doing this but I never heard a peep (although its possible I had a guardian angel somewhere in the company).","43_1"

But there are some that cant be detected. For example:

* MikroTik router at home on my Verizon FiOS setup
* Mobile setup is a 5G router connected to another MikroTik router. This MikroTik router is a WiFi AP, and acts as a bridge, tunneled to the MikroTik at home. All IP addresses are assigned by the Verizon router at home over the tunnel. 

I believe that the only ways you could detect that would be:
* latency increase (highly unreliable and not good proof)
* Laptop could upload a list of WiFi APs it can see, and the company geo located those (Only way around that would be turning off WiFi, and if you had admin you could still have it turn WiFi on to do scans, so Id have to physically disconnect the antennas)

Id be interested in hearing if your husband thinks he could spot that. :)

Not one interview or opportunity from these sites.  

Once the pandemic was in full swing, I started messaging or responding to recruiters on LinkedIn and being very direct with my telecommute requirement.  90%+ of recruiters couldn't help me, but 10% genuinely said they would keep an eye out for a remote position that suited my skillset.  One recruiter messaged me 6 months after our initial conversation and said he finally found a role he thought I would be interested in and boy did he deliver.  I am 100% remote now with a great salary.  

I actually bought a house in NV while living in MN and looking for work because I didn't want to miss the covid interest rate discount.  People told me I was crazy but I DESPERATELY wanted to leave Minneapolis after living a quarter mile from George Floyd square next to the billions of dollars in damages and burned neighborhoods.

I moved to NV in January, and was supposed to return to MN office in June, but landed my dream job in May (just in time).  

For years I tried to hide my interest in remote work, but after no progress in my search, I decided that if I wasn't very direct, my dream would never happen.  After that, I forced every conversation I had with recruiters to focus on remote work. 

""Thanks for reaching out but I am only interested in pursuing remote opportunities at this time.   I hope you'll keep me in mind for future roles that meet this criteria...blah blah blah""

TLDR - Network, network, network.  Tell them what you want and reject them if they won't budge.  Have your resume, cover letter and LinkedIn responses drafted so you can power through hundreds of recruiters.","2_1_1"

There are certain job functions that really don't need people to visit the office on a regular basis. 4 days in a month for collaboration purposes or maybe for team building activities makes sense. Companies that are trying to go back to the otherwise obsolete system will either see a higher rate of employees quitting. It is about time we accept remote work as a part of our work culture.

1. The barrier to entry is one of the lowest, you can do your hello world and then move onto next part of learning without massive effort. 
2. Because it's so widely used, it has a library for ""almost"" everything. 

Once you have the basic down to a level of having a working understanding, doing practical world applications is ""possible"". More so than most of the other languages. For example you can just pick up flask or fastapi and make a basic web application. You can also just grab a library that lets you interact with systems commands, or one for API of a popular website. 

But it all comes down to diving in and getting started. You can start working on java but that looks like a mountain to climb and you will have to spend much longer time studying and struggling if that is your first language. Where as with python, you can just dive right in, you might write a mess and it may not even work. But you will have done something on day 1. Once you've learned core programming logic from having done python and switch to a more strongly typed language, you don't have to relearn the basics again like how flow controls, loops or functions work. Only big change you see is some syntax changes and you can focus on what really makes ""that"" language different. 

So instead of looking for reasons why an easy to learn starting language isn't perfect. Take a page from nike logo and just do it. You will get a lot further from just doing things than you will trying to get a perfect idea on paper before even touching the keyboard. Unless you are some sort of a genius, which I am not and I honestly don't know what rules apply to those folks. The best I can do offer practical advice for majority of folks that will have same hurdles as I do.","2_3_1"

The result? It didn't make a damn difference because the real difficulty isn't in syntax, but in logic etc. 

After coding for enough time people tend to forget just what a struggle it is for newbies to get into it. It takes a lot of time, dedication and grit to learn enough to be employable.

Basic python takes a bunch of time and on its own it's quite useless so there's a lot more to learn. You mentioned web dev, whohooow pandoras box galore! Databases, SQL or mongoDB, security, GIT, Front end, Back end, API's, Authentication, Postman, Scrum, requirements engineering,... there's a ton of stuff to it if you want to be professional so let's not send people on some sort of pipe dream thinking that knowing basic python is enough to be hirable because it's not by a long shot.","2_3_1_1"

Like programming, you can try writing, which is one of the most in-demand freelanicng skill. Basic content writing is something that doesn't require a lot of experience. If you have a good grasp of Grammar and you know a particular language really well, especially English, you'll be able to find some writing gigs. 

The freedom with writing is that you can choose to write about things you love. It can be topics like lifestyle, tech, fashion, etc. Chances are, topics that you want to write about are already in great demand. 

Similar to writing, other skills that don't require extensive experience are data entry, basic social media management, virtual assistant, transcription, and customer service. 

Of course, these will be extremely competitive but if you can put in a few hours to build a neat portfolio and get yourself out there, you'll eventually win gigs. 

You can take a look at this article on the [most demanded digital skills](https://www.remote-work.io/top-in-demand-digital-skills/) if you wish to try something else. The reason I'm putting this here is if you're going for a skill that doesn't require much expertise, it's better if that falls among the most demanded ones so that you're not searching in the void.

 The only question is how will we globally/societally transition to it. Done right, it could lead to a Star Trekian utopia where needs are met and people are free to pursue whatever interests them. Done wrong, it could lead to the utter and total breakdown of society, as the ""haves"" try in vain to protect their riches against the increasingly large hoardes of people with absolutely nothing to lose.

I currently use AI to write code for me, but it's never production-ready code. it does save a fair amount of time. At this point, it's not great, but it often suggests things I had not thought of. With the growth curve of AI, I think it's all a matter of time before it takes over.

* Where are you searching for remote jobs? I would stick to legit job sites like Indeed.
* Ignore any job that requires you to pay anything.
* I honestly would try to stick to well-known companies for now.
* Continue to post here and ask if you're unsure that it's legit.
* Also, I haven't interviewed in a while, but I think that you shouldn't need to provide your social security number before a job interview. I think that you should interview first and then if they want to hire you, they'll ask for that.
* And, of course, before you give out any personal info, be sure to research the company.
* I also set up temporary phone numbers and email addresses for job searches in case you accidentally apply w a scammer.  

* You can try a temp agency, too. They'll vet the companies for you. But, with a temp agency, you may not get as much money as someone who applied directly w the company.

Also, I see that the msg is part of a text exchange. I think that we can all agree that this is a scam, but I'm just curious how you and this person started talking via text and you have her #/name saved, but only started talking about the basics of pay during that conversation. Most companies would discuss that first or have it listed in the job description to weed out ppl who don't want the job. Just seems odd.","82"

Businesses get better deals than regular retail. They save a ton by buying in bulk. Also it's easier to support stuff when everyone is running the same stuff.

Also when I read the first paragraph, to me it translated ""we pay you. we pay with money. real money. we will deposit it in your account. money is real, no need to worry about it."" They just said too much about pay. I wouldn't expect this discussion until I was hired 

And if they can pay you with a bank transfer, then why would they mail you a paper check for your equipment? Bank transfer would be more secure and faster.

Theyve got some years on their resume (late 20s-early 30s age range). Their jobs are stressful but theyve got more freedom when they work from home. What I mean is their bosses arent checking in every 5 minutes because theyre expected to know what theyre doing and have a good deal of responsibility already. My boyfriends job is through some software and you have to be present by the computer because itll show youre inactive if you dont move your mouse or type after 5 minutes. 

My parents neighbor is some big shot corporate guy who travels frequently to other countries for big meetings. When hes not doing that he works from home. He has told us that working from home is nice and all, but that a lot more is expected from him. Hes expected to work faster, get more done, get distracted less.

I used to babysit a lot. This one family had a baby but both parents worked from home. They just wanted a couple hours a day where they could focus on their job and their meetings. So Id watch their kid. I realized there was so much distraction in their house (or any house). Even when Id watch their kid the infant would cry and scream until the parents would have to be like sorry everyone Ill be right back and theyd leave the meeting and tend to the baby. Because the infant literally was such a distraction.

**LinkedIn**

The best resource for getting a remote job is LinkedIn. That's where I've received most of my job offers as of late. 

From what I keep reading in these threads and other forums is the lack of understanding how to search for remote roles or what to look for.

**Niche. Niche. Niche.**

What I would do is look for a particular niche (fashion, automotive, news, healthcare, finance, edtech) and then narrow down from there. For instance, If I've been in automotive and worked for Brembo (brake company), then I might be aware of other names or automotive vendors.

So then it comes down again to--who do you know? As in what company do you know? Is it retail like Macys? Then Nordstrom has remote roles. Catering? Sodexo might have remote roles or a tech platform that underpins their delivery.

**Find a company's social proof.**

When you are on their website or talk to them on the phone, then see what companies do they work for or contract for. A website should also have press-releases of the new stuff they've done and who've they partnered with--look them up. What's their social media presence? What is their follower count on LinkedIn, twitter, IG? Where is the company HQ? I look for San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, Austin, Boston, and NYC (to name a few).

**Name holds weight.**

If you want a better rule of thumb. I look for companies that LinkedIn shows other connections work or have worked. Be stingy about a company, but again know your niche. I always tell people name holds weight even in the startup world. And you are also better off applying to bigger or well known companies, since most people are not applying to those and apply to lower hanging fruit.","13_1_1_1"

Usually for entry level, you're generally customer support of some variation, or some other form of grunt worker that does generally need to be working constantly, or at least consistently enough. When you get higher on the totem pole, there's more wait time between communications and more layers of people to get through before people or projects approach you, so you generally have more free time.

My job offers me buckets of free time. Like I literally spend most days playing video games. My manager doesn't micromanage, in fact I'm fairly certain *she's* not around most of the time either.

This has tax implications for you and the Company. I don't think this will save you from being expected to report in person to the office. Someone did this at my company - moved to another state and they were let go because of moving, amongst other issues.  They also sucked at their job but the moving to another state really sped things up from my perspective and put a target on their back. It was definitely used against them. But if you are on good terms and a valued employee-perhaps they will be able to accomodate you? It's worth asking.

But like others said, I would start interviewing asap anyways. I also worked remote prior to the pandemic and I really am only looking for remote jobs for the rest of my career. Realistically, I would only go back to working in person if I ever found a unicorn job that was super short commute (like 5 - 10 minutes from my house) for a super-great company with significant above-market compensation. AKA Not likely!

You put in 4 years there, thats a lot in today's world. I think it will look perfectly fine on your resume and to potential employers that you are looking for a new role because your company has changed their in-person/remote work policy.

It can seem daunting if you're introverted, but putting yourself out there is the only way to make new connections. Also, don't try to do everything; try one new thing and see if it sticks  before you try something else on the list.

It also goes without saying you'll want to use common sense if you get weird vibes from some of these new acquaintances. You don't have to become friends with everyone.

If it wasnt for the fact that WFH is so convenient and you save a lot of money I would change it for an in person work in a heartbeat. I live in a place where if you dont drink there are very few places to socialize and I dont drink also is not a place where there are a lot of activities like you normally see in big cities so that doesnt help, but hey! My mortgage is $600 so I dont plan to move any time soon ==. 

What kind of works for me is create a routine to make pauses during the day, like take the dogs out or every other day go and have lunch outside. One thing I like of my current job is that we meet once a year in person and every other week we have a Teams call were we talk about everything, it could be work, kids, pets, weather, football or whatever, that helps.

It also helps if you can afford it go to a coworking space. It is also important to make most use of the time you are not working, I do more date nights with my wife than when I was in office and make sure we do something on the weekends and not stay home, that help discharge the stress of the isolation. Even if you are single you can still do all these things.

We deal with this by focusing on our hobbies in fitness and art by going to classes. And strengthening the friendships we already have via texts and video calls and going out rather often and meeting fellow travellers.

My social groups had picked back up post pandemic but I was still staying home as I were in quarantine which was making work life waaay too important. I went back to doing my hobbies, making more of an effort to invite people out and say yes when I received invitations. And I also mentally right-set because work is not about making friends.

I was just a coworker and she was directing her energy where it would do the most good for her career which was to the people on her new team.

Other people I'll do an open call where I'm working and they can join and we leave the line open for hours to talk through any work issues or just bullshit about monster trucks or music.

The take-away: If you're only communicating with colleagues when you have an issue, you will probably be lonely. It's okay to work on different stuff together over speaker phone. It brings a lot more energy and it's enjoyable just having someone around.","57"

So they gave me a hybrid schedule. I understand how you feel because even though I only go to the office half the time, I HATE it. I feel like my week is completely messed up and half the time I don't even know what day it is when I wake up. I feel more exhausted working hybrid. Plus, my co-workers are rude to me because they are mad I got the hybrid schedule. (They are all VERY immature.) So now I'm looking for a 100% remote job. I don't have the heart to ask them for 100% remote so I would rather just start fresh somewhere else.

I think the only thing you can do if you want to be honest is tell them something like, ""I need to find a 100% remote position and I'm really hoping you can agree to it because I love my job so much."" I don't think you need to say why specifically (or you could do a generic ""family reasons"" or ""personal reasons"") but I think the key thing is to tell them how much you love the company and your job. Depending on the size of the company, that could mean a lot.","16"

Do you want to stay at the company and move up? If you do it's a really good idea to be a familiar face around the office. Be seen in the halls by the CEO. Talk to people in other departments about their kids, go to lunch and cut up a little. Otherwise someone in the C suite is eventually going to be asking someone like me what you do for the company and do we really need you? Before I retired I drove 75 miles to work 3 days a week. They didn't ask me to move out of town and I was too far up the org chart to just phone it in every day. Even the people that lived on the opposite coast were expected to be in the office 1 week out of each quarter.","19"
