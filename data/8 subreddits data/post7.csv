"2021-05-19",1621436907,"Feeling wary of the new mask rules.","I got my second Pfizer dose last week, so Ill be fully immunized in about another week. However, I still feel really weird about going out. Ive been super careful this whole time and I have a work from home job. Ive developed some OCD tendencies around sanitizing surfaces and I do have anxiety (which Im working on with a therapist) but I feel really anxious about going out when Im not sure if others are vaccinated. 

For example,

I know this sounds so pointless, but I want to get my hair done and something about sitting in a room with multiple other people masked (or possibly unmasked depending on the salon policy) freaks me out. The trip alone would take a few hours and my rational mind is trying to tell me to just do it but it feels like such a big risk. 

I feel similarly with seeing friends as well. It feels super odd to be afraid of doing any sort of activity. I want to just dive head on, but the fear of the last year is real.","COVID19_support",32,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/ng8c7t/feeling_wary_of_the_new_mask_rules/"
"2021-05-02",1619978083,"I broke off contact with my mother over COVID.","My mother works in a nursing home. She is an occupational therapist. She was abusive when I was a child, but more in a thoughtless, narcissistic way than truly sadistic. I moved out just after high school graduation and I have never gone back.

One of the things my mom likes to do is send me forwarded e-mails with ""important health information"". It's all either natural-health stuff or outright quackery, from harmless things like ""you probably need to drink more water"" to outright scary anti-vaccine propaganda. This last year, it's been COVID denial--things like it isn't real, it's just the flu, it's a scam, and so on and so forth.

I've done my best to explain to her how I know it's real--how we're having more deaths, how funeral homes are overwhelmed, what happened during the COVID spikes in Italy and New York City. I've done the math for her. I've linked her to journal articles. I've been patient. I've been kind. And... she still won't listen. It's like she acknowledges my logic, and then links me to another one of her gurus, citing their credentials as though that meant they were always right.

They started vaccinating nursing home workers. Mom didn't want the vaccine. She said that if they made it mandatory she'd quit her job instead, and retire. I tried to convince her. I explained to her how she could literally kill the people she was working with, especially since she doesn't wear a mask except at work where she's required to. Naturally it's not mandatory, because America, so she hasn't retired, and she's working in a nursing home without a vaccine. And in the end, I just couldn't take it anymore. I broke off contact.

It's freeing. It's an odd relief. I've got my aunt coming after me, trying to broker peace, and I hope I can stick to my guns without insulting her, because my aunt's so sweet and it's not her fault my mother doesn't care whether other people live or die just as long as she feels like she's got the inside scoop and knows better than anybody else about health and all of that.

And now... I guess I don't have much of a family anymore. I have my sister; she's sensible and kind. She lives a couple of states away, so we have to talk by IM. I'm just so frustrated that I couldn't get my mom to listen, no matter how carefully and logically I explained things--because logic just doesn't work on her.","COVID19_support",15,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/n3bvlv/i_broke_off_contact_with_my_mother_over_covid/"
"2020-03-20",1584730041,"I cried at work today because I cant handle the stress of COVID","I've been having such a hard time mentally. Sometimes I feel like it's no big deal, and I'll be okay. But that's just because I'm forcing myself to stop thinking about the virus to try and get a moment's peace.

There was one confirmed case in my state last week. As of today, there are 96. It feels like everything around me is spinning out of control and I'm in a horror movie. Global epidemics are my biggest fear and I feel so trapped and hopeless.

I have a very very hard time thinking of what's going to happen if I get sick. I'll either have to lose my job from staying home, or go and get tested, and be a damn confirmed case and have them talk about me like I'm some kind of animal. ""Receiving care at this time"", things like that. The idea of being added to the numbers alone makes me stop in absolute fear. I cant handle that. I cant be in isolation, I cant be taken and held down for 2 plus weeks with doctors surrounding me at all times. 

If I get sick, I *WILL* kill myself. I cannot see any feasible way that I'll  be able to continue living as if nothing happened.

I got pulled to the side by one of my coworkers after I'd made some remarks about my fear of being a number, in which he told me that I would have to be tested, because I'd either lose my job or possibly get our immunocompromised coworker critically ill. And i started crying like a stupid little bitch. I didnt want to cry but I've always been sensitive and so it really hurt to know that I had no way around it. 

Idk what to do anymore. I'm honestly considering killing myself at this point. I feel so dragged down and hopeless and I dont know what I'm supposed to do. I cant work from home. My job (grocery store, deli counter) wont close. I'm at a loss, it just feels like everything is shattering around me.

I'd rather die than live with this hopelessness.","COVID19_support",43,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fm0clb/i_cried_at_work_today_because_i_cant_handle_the/"
"2020-08-07",1596838512,"Work isn't going well, have tons of credit card debt, and it looks like congress won't pass a 2nd stimulus bill","Right now work isn't going very well because I'm having issues dealing with stress at work and I'm having a hard time factoring in what could go wrong at work. So far I've had multiple jobs that had issues this week and I'm getting nervous I could get let go from the platform. I do freelance home device installs (like mounting TVs or installing alarm systems). If I get let go from this platform I don't think I could get another job due to lots of high paying jobs being work from home (which I can't do due to mental health issues). Right now I also have tons of Cc debt and have to spend a lot of money on therapy due to no in person options for official therapy that is covered by my insurance. I'm currently doing cuddle therapy which is an unofficial form of therapy and also illegal under my areas stay at home order due to no social distancing or mask wearing (but the virus rules aren't being enforced in my area luckily). Which is pretty expensive, but I have no choice due to online therapy being ineffective for me. I could move back home to save money, but it wouldn't solve the issue of having to break my lease and having to spend tons of cuddle therapy. I'm pretty upset that congress won't pass a 2nd stimulus bill and also pretty scared as well. Sometimes I've even thought of suicide due to my money and job issues. I barely have any credit left right now","COVID19_support",10,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/i5nd1l/work_isnt_going_well_have_tons_of_credit_card/"
"2021-02-01",1612196480,"I think I ""found"" myself during this pandemic","Anyone have experiences that have totally changed their outlook since the start of the pandemic? Here, I'll go first:

The pandemic made me realize my employer has no allegiance to me and from a high level, does not care about me. I've been with the same research hospital for 10 years. My boss is excellent but turns out she is powerless in determining my workload and the direction of our team. One person had a personal meltdown at the beginning and refused to come to work, we got no help. Two people quit over the fall and we received zero help, zero allowance to slow down work while we hired replacements. All the existing staff is doing the work of at least 2 people and she has no power to persuade upper management for more help if they don't feel like giving it. The old me would give 110% every day for the sake of ""the department"" - but I just don't have it in me these days. My husband has had it even worse - his employer has given zero covid-guidelines, doesn't enforce masks or anything of the sort. Guys pick up covid, and have to sit out, they just toss another guy in w/o investigating the source or requiring testing to come back. We've been terrified that he'll pick it up from work. 

It also made me realize that I directed a lot of my life based on my daily interactions with other adults. Other adults have children, so therefore I should, too. Have done a lot of soul-searching over the last year, and I just don't think I want kids. It's not something I think will bring me joy. Will I feel left out of a lot of adult female conversations? Sure, but I should have known for myself earlier why my eyes glaze over whenever my coworkers talk about their kids. Now that I'm untethered from that everyday, I realize that I just never wanted it for myself. Same for my personal interests. I decorated my home like a proper ""adult"" based on how visitors would think of my home, but now that no one is coming around to judge it, I want to re-decorate my house with things that I like. I also like anime and comics and video games again without feeling ashamed, because there isn't anyone around TO shame me. I got super into gardening and homesteading and living a more sustainable life. I want to disconnect from the American consumer culture and live a simpler life. All my tattoos are in hidden places for the sake of looking ""professional"" for when I went to my big girl job. Now that everything is remote, and remote work is here to stay, I feel more inclined to get those visible tattoos I've always wanted. Other people at work have them, but for some reason I didn't allow myself to be included in that group of people.

Life used to be go, go, go all the time. Working in the city M-F, upwards of 50/60+ hours a week and being too exhausted to do anything of personal substance on the weekends. My husband and I have done a lot of soul-searching the last year or so, and realized that we are really just done with the rat race. We will work hard and pay our bills like we always do, but we don't want to kill ourselves for our employer anymore, or let ""society"" dictate how we live our lives. We put ""us"" aside for so long to do the things society said we were ""supposed"" to do, and want to take that time back and then some.

It's 9:30 am, my appointment is at 12:15pm. My support buddies will be heading over in about two hours. Trying to just keep mentally calm and cool to prepare for this. Lidocaine is on my arm and all wrapped up in cling wrap. I've been practicing the last few days putting alcohol wipes on my arm to get used to the sensation and smell since that's such a big trigger for the fear. I also read somewhere about putting scented lotion under your nose. I thought that was brilliant so I packed up my favorite B&amp;BW Midnight in my bag too. Got a few things to pack into my care bag for myself (my plush friend, baby wipes to clean off the lido, my favorite banana milk, my phone, my headphones, I got animal crossing loaded up, and my favorite music) and then I'll just chill for a bit until my buddies show up. My sister called me to offer me her support just a little bit ago and I've had some very encouraging words from friends. Reading over all the kind things everyone said in part 1..you guys give me strength. I'll do my best! Insha'Allah this is the year we make a dent in my needle phobia. Starting with one of the most important vaccines I can decide to get. I keep trying to remember it's for a good cause. There's a good reason to get over my fear in general..and now is the best way to start. If I can get vaccinated, I should, for the sake of those who can't. I will get through this. Thank you everyone for your kinds words. We're in this together and I love all of you. Thank you.

I'll give another update when I get home.

&amp;#x200B;

1:25pm update: I'm home again. I cried a lot as I knew I would. It was really REALLY hard. The lido helped, the music help, everything people suggested helped. I still don't know if I'm even 10% okay with everything but it's a big step forward. I actually went in and got it done. I didn't run away, I didn't flinch..I just went in and got it done. The tech was really professional and very accommodating of how I was feeling.  Still not as easy as the dentist. If only all shots could be given in the gums. I still don't think I'm at the point where I can do it alone but this is miles better than anything I've done before so I'll take it. I am proud of myself for doing it..I just wish it hadn't been so hard. But..it's still better than walking home on a broken ankle because you're afraid of going to the hospital, lol. I willingly went to the pharmacy to do this so definitely miles better than I was.

I wish I could make this update happy and how everything is okay but I'm not okay and I know that. But I'm trying. I'll stay hydrated and try to do something that keeps me happy to avoid crying and dehydrating too much more.  I'll need more tissues next time I go. I ran through the back I had way too fast.

But if I can do it..I know others can too. Lidocaine helps. Distractions help. I can do it, so can you &lt;3 ","COVID19_support",13,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/pmuatm/vaccination_day_morbid_needle_fear_p_2/"

No fast food, no friends, no hangouts, no shopping, sanitize all packages and groceries(acquired by online pickup only) before they come in the house nothing due to my elderly parents who live with me being super high risk.

Hello guys, 

The last few months (maybe with an exception of summer) were pretty hard for me. Just before the pandemic I moved into a new city, I was hoping to make some friends, socialise, go to the gym, clubs etc. At the moment I work at home, I only go out to buy some groceries. It has already been said, that those measures will stay here in Germany for at least one month, but we all know that they will start to relax in April. 

Since the beginning of the pandemic in March I am on this strange rollercoaster, going from thinking ""ok, this is how we will live right now, at least we will get summer"" to ""I dont want to live like that anymore"". To make matters worse, I am considered to be a covid-denier because I criticise the actions takens by the governments all over the world.

I am convinced, that this pandemic will not end and that we can forget about a life we had back in 2019. Clubs, stadiums, parties, convents, expos - its over. For good. Maybe we will be able to go to the gym and restaurants in the Summer. During Autumn and Winter though we will be having lockdowns, almost every year. It is really hard at the moment, I am single male 29, and meeting somebody is pretty f.... hard nowadays. The problem however - I dont see any perspective. Even some virologist and other experts write in their articles that there is no going back and we need to discuss if we want to reopen clubs - because maybe they are already obsolete and they do not fit the brave new world. 

I have given myself some time untill the end of the next year, if the situation will not improve, I will start to look for another place to live. It does not make sense to live like that.","COVID19_support",58,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/k6xkmq/i_am_afraid_that_this_pandemic_will_trully_never/"

I know I have it so much better than most as my husband and I are still working (and from home).

I feel like I have kept myself pretty even keeled but today I feel so down.

I am an elementary school teacher and I have started dreading my live meetings. Some of the kids' little faces look so sad and confused.

"2020-05-13",1589389344,"A Conflicted Scientist","This whole pandemic and the public response to it has been incredibly hard on me as a scientist who studied immunology, mental health, and public health (I now work in science admin). 

A lot of this education would point me towards the pro-lockdown direction, but, instead I'm feeling very anti-lockdown lately and I've been getting backlash from my fellow scientists as a result. 

The thing is, my truth is very different from what they are experiencing. They have the luxury of telling the general public that we need to lockdown or cancel mass gatherings until there is a vaccine while still having the ability to either work from home or having to work for the healthcare system (and also acknowledging that the average vaccine takes a decade to be mass-produced). While I have to sit at home and listen to my roommates, who both work for the restaurant industry, talk about wanting to commit suicide because their dream jobs are cancelled until further notice. I work for the research side of a major hospital and we are facing the possibility of layoffs and furloughs because the hospital lost so much money to having to cancel non-COVID related procedures and the fact that job-loss means loss of health insurance in the US. 

The complete disregard for the collateral damage caused by these lockdowns has me furious. Mental health, substance abuse, stress-induced illnesses, homelessness, and the fear of going to the doctor leading to those who could've been saved dying or having long-term damage (referring to the fact that heart attacks, strokes, and other non-COVID related emergencies are at a decline lately due to people not going to the ER anymore) are ALSO PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH! We seem to be sacrificing all other areas of public health for one small area for a disease that's proving more and more to be LESS deadly than we originally thought for the average person. 

It's becoming harder and harder to respect scientists through all of this. They have clearly bought into the doom and gloom and have completely abandoned all rational thought while insulting those who are suffering due to lockdowns. I am a big proponent of scientists getting a better reputation in the general public, but this is definitely ruining that for me. 

Don't get me wrong, I have also been in contact with amazing scientists that are focusing on this disease. Having a virologist as one of my program heads has been a huge help and he's been very reasonable about all of this. He seems similar to me with this: he wants the push to be towards funding contact tracing, antibody testing, and increased incidence testing. He despises the fact that these lockdowns have been extended without these, basically making them and the collateral damage last longer. There seems to be a growing number of scientists and healthcare workers who are worried about the collateral damage as well, and I hope they get more attention soon. The longer we push these lockdowns and ignore those who are suffering who might not have if things were at least somewhat normal, the more I fear that scientists and politicians will not be trusted in the future, even if they are proposing reasonable restrictions- and that can be very, very dangerous.","COVID19_support",19,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gj2zt0/a_conflicted_scientist/"
"2020-08-08",1596907553,"High risk, living with a plague rat","I live in the USA, in a city which is currently a COVID hot spot.

I rent the basement of a friend's house. I have various physical glitches that make me high-risk, including asthma. Colds usually make my asthma flare up; the flu once put me in the hospital. Therefore, high-risk.

My friend is currently upstairs having a get-together with some ""friends from high school"", including several children. Nobody is wearing a mask. They're all indoors. He hasn't even opened the windows.

Yesterday, when he went to work, I noticed both his masks were still on the kitchen table. He has repeatedly not been wearing a mask to work or in public. This bothers me because he is young and healthy and likely to get an asymptomatic case and spread it when he goes to work--a job which involves repeatedly going into people's homes.

He's been having D&amp;D games in the living room. I asked the group to please have them online, but they won't. He only sets up a web cam so I can participate remotely from the basement. 

To make this worse, I am disabled and don't drive; so he is the only transportation I have if I don't want to use a taxi. With his behavior getting more and more careless as the pandemic gets worse and worse, I feel like I simply can't risk letting him drive me anywhere. Luckily, I grow some of my own food in the garden out back.

I'm so tired of him being so absolutely careless. He seems to think that he's going to get COVID no matter what happens, so he might as well stop taking precautions. He doesn't understand that as a a young, healthy person, he could become a disease vector and spread COVID to everyone whose house he enters during the course of his job, everyone who comes into our house--and very likely to me, thorough the air conditioning system which we share. 

I was hoping that I wouldn't have to isolate myself completely because he would be careful enough that I could consider him part of my household. But it's becoming increasingly clear to me that I am going to have to isolate myself from him, too.

I need to lay down the law: He is not to come downstairs. I can't take rides from him anymore; I need to get my groceries delivered. I feel like I should quit that D&amp;D game, too, because if I participate, I'm enabling these social gatherings which are entirely too risky.

I thought my friend was a kind person. He has always helped me in the past, and has always helped other people. But it seems now that his willingness to help stops when it inconveniences him.

I stopped volunteering at the library when the pandemic hit--the library is my favorite place in the whole world. I've made over a thousand cloth masks for my neighbors. My friend has even donated money for supplies for those masks--but he's got a steady job and he's got money to spare, if his patronage of restaurants and his high-end electronics are any indication. It seems that when it comes to going out of his way, he no longer wants to help other people. He doesn't have the patience or the self-control to wait this out, to be careful, to avoid becoming a COVID vector.

I worry that he thinks I'm a coward, that I'm paranoid. But that's not the way it is. This is a worldwide pandemic, it's killing off our elders. My grandmother just died two weeks ago, alone in her nursing home because of this pandemic, and I couldn't even go to her funeral! This is real, and he doesn't seem to understand it.

However, I have seen the reactions from my neighbors and community members and I feel no desire to want to get out and interact among them.  I've seen the comments left under our local news posts, under the Neighborhood apps, etc., and it really upsets me.  These are the type of posts that aren't just expressing doubt about the science behind the pandemic... while those make me roll my eyes that wouldn't stop me from leaving my house... but there was so much vitriol on these posts against people who supported the lock down or even just supported wearing masks.  Lots of comments along the lines of not caring if elderly or compromised people die, etc.  I've always known my values haven't always matched the values of my community members, and that has been ok as I feel like I'm making a difference from within, but the sheer number of brutal, no empathy, laughing-at-your-pain comments is frightening.  Every time I go for a walk now I feel like I am watching my neighbors at the park with a suspicious eye... ""Is that nice looking lady who is laughing at her child playing the one that couldn't care less if I died tomorrow?"" ""Is that man the one that stated we need to reopen everything tomorrow and only have the elderly/compromised stay home, even if their job requires they return to work?"" It's just easier to cocoon myself in my house this summer and not interact with the general public at all.  However, I have to physically return to work on June 15th, and quite honestly, am dreading it.  The area of the country I live in was making strides towards letting others know that racist and homophobic statements are no longer acceptable, so it seems like those who hold those views are now expressing their hateful thoughts through the pandemic... and it is accepted as fine to do so.  It has become evident even through mask wearing... hardly anyone in my town wears them, and I and two of my friends have noticed on separate occasions how hostile people are in person when they see you wearing a mask.  Is anyone else anxious about going out not because of the pandemic, but because of how hateful their local community has been towards those that are being cautious?
EDIT: I want to edit this post to add that I realize what I am going through is NOTHING compared to what is happening nationally right now (USA) and looking back on my post I am feeling like I was a little tone-deaf. What I have experienced is nothing compared to what others have experienced with regards to meanness, hostility, brutality, systematic oppression, and more.

We simply do not have the necessary social programs to keep the millions of people and small business afloat until the virus has been contained. I have no confidence in our current leadership to approve things like UBI and bailouts for small businesses. People keep saying things like ""this will be worse than the great depression"" with out us even getting that far into this yet. I know some of it is just trying to grab attention, but to what end can we successfully pull us out of our current situation in a reasonable amount of time? I (thankfully) have a job I can work from home, but I know that I am just as susceptible to being laid off as anyone else if this goes on for too long.

"2021-11-04",1636039828,"Encouragement for still being scared of COVID post-vax?","My husband and I (31M and 29F respectively) were vaccinated late March (both doses of Pfizer), and after being vaccinated, eased up on personal restrictions. We started seeing family and friends a lot more, and taking vacations / eating out again. Unfortunately, since the rise of Delta in our area mid-summer, we returned to being a lot more careful (a lot of social isolation) since it seemed like vaccinated folks could get and spread COVID, and there were a lot of unknowns when it was a new variant.

Now, I'm still personally struggling with getting back to most social activities (e.g., seeing friends who are actually vaccinated, going back to indoor dining, going to crowded outdoor activities like concerts and sports games). I keep hearing that vaccine efficacy wanes over time, and it's been almost 8 months since we got ours, and we don't qualify for a third dose yet. I'm also concerned about our limited knowledge of long COVID, and of being in the small percentage of vaccinated folks that could get really ill.

We both work from home, and don't have many situations where we need to interact with others that aren't purely voluntary. I understand that given the fact that we are young and healthy, our cases would likely be mild. But after the last 1.5 years of trying to just not get COVID at all, it's hard to shift mindsets and be ok with the risk of getting sick.

We're also returning to our (likely mask-less but very vaccinated) offices in the new year, and that has made me pretty stressed. Is there any data that has been very encouraging to others to tamp down anxiety of contracting COVID to get back to the office and enjoy more social activities (especially indoors, as it's getting colder out)?","COVID19_support",17,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/qmn4ws/encouragement_for_still_being_scared_of_covid/"
"2021-09-24",1632457374,"Covid ruined us financially and emotionally","I'm 22 and have lived with my dad since 2017. It sort of worked out okay, because he had an office job that he went to 5 days a week so I had at least some space when I wasn't in class or working.

Then covid hit, and he had to work from home indefinitely. Even after the vaccines. He literally does not go anywhere, he has no social life, so he was pretty much home 24/7 and I we would start butting heads more. He kept assuring me he'd go back eventually though.

But a few months ago, he was laid off because the pandemic hit the company hard and they had to make a cut; they decided the cut was going to be him. So now there's no end in sight. I feel I have very little personal space and it's driving me insane. It's all the typical issues one may have when living with their parents as an adult, except the parent in question literally never leaves the house. Ever. On top of that, I've become the sole provider without warning, and I'm a part timer college student making MAYBE $1000 a month if I'm really lucky. I was planning on moving out with a couple friends, but I'm afraid of the guilt accompanying that now. 

My dad has tried and failed to reach an actual human being about getting his unemployment for months now- it's been an endless cycle of of applying &gt; not hearing anything &gt; checking status &gt; case has expired for some reason &gt; try to contact &gt; nobody is ever available &gt; try applying again. 

I've been trying to get back to the things I missed out on last year to cheer myself up, but it's really hard. Even if this all finally passes, that does nothing to help the financial and emotional situation. I tried looking into therapy, but surprise surprise, I can't afford it even with insurance.","COVID19_support",11,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/puc9de/covid_ruined_us_financially_and_emotionally/"
"2021-02-14",1613294178,"Worried about the new normal concerning masks and social distancing.","Gonna start this off by saying that I wear a mask every time I leave the house and I intend to do so as long as is needed for the safety of myself and others. I also do my best to keep my distance (although I live in a state where people dont really even believe covid is real). Im not trying to say anyone should stop doing these things for the time being. 

I guess what Im trying to say is that I have autism and some of the ways that we have changed our behavior dont really get along well with the ways Ive found to function in the world, and if this is the way life is gonna be forever or at least very long term, its going to be incredibly stressful on me. 

Because of my autism I am incredibly bad at eye contact. As in, it makes me very uncomfortable to look someone directly in the eyes. As a way to get around that, Im usually looking at someones nose or mouth when they talk so I can still see them but its not scary for me. Since everyone is wearing masks now (and like I said, please continue to do so) I cant look at noses and mouths anymore. I dont really get to see faces at all as of now without it making me super uncomfortable. It feels more isolating than youd think. 

Social distancing is also hard on me because I am just incredibly lonely. I was lonely even before I wasnt able to hug my mom or visit my siblings. I rely on the presence of other people a lot to function, and I moved out of my parents house recently to live with a friend. But one person can only do so much in the way of company, and I miss my family a lot and I cant visit. My baby brother is growing up and Im missing all of it. 

Zoom/FaceTime calls do not do anything for me anymore. All the traditional ways of getting through it (distracting myself, video calls, therapy, whatever) no longer cut it. And i cant even try to fully embrace the stay at home thing because I have to work a retail job to survive. I just deal with tons of people who just ignore everything going on and then I go home and do my best to put the needs of the world before my own comfort. 

And I know this is all stupid to complain about. People are dying every single day. People are losing their entire families to covid and Im sitting here whining about how hard it is for me to look people in the eyes. I feel guilty for even being upset about the petty things that upset me. I feel like one of those people that were protesting the lockdowns because they wanted haircuts. I feel so gross about it. I dont expect anything to be done for me I guess, but I dont know how to handle it. 

I guess I just want an endpoint. I want to know that someday Ill get to hug my grandparents again. Hopefully before they pass away. I want to be able to leave the house and be around people just because I want some time away from my house. I see so many articles about how people will never be able to hug each other again and that video dates will become the only dates forever and that basically everyone will work from home because were never going to be safe again. I know its probably fake but Im still scared. I dont even feel comfortable going to therapy and stuff again because of multiple traumatic experiences with it. 

So yeah I guess I dont really know where I was going with this. Its 3 am and this stuff is keeping me awake again so sorry if its a bit incoherent.","COVID19_support",11,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/ljl9fa/worried_about_the_new_normal_concerning_masks_and/"

I started a position after school in January 2020 at a really large food company where things were crazy busy too. While I hated the work, but I enjoyed that level of chaos. I liked reading, making guides/notes for myself, and meeting new people. 

Then I started to work from home in March 2020. All my projects got canceled or paused and I feel like my coworkers forgot about me. I would go to our check-in meetings and try to see how everyone was and they literally didnt reciprocate. I gave up trying to connect. I got BS projects to work on or I would have projects kick off for a month, get canceled because of something like factory or business constraints, and go through the process of canceling or shelving it. Over and over until November.

I had moved for this job. I had no one to even social distance with except one friend who I rarely saw due to the vulnerability of the folks she worked with. My husband was still going into his office the whole pandemic so I was home by myself from 8AM - 6PM 5-6 days a week. 

I started to zone out in meetings, got on my phone a lot, and because I was getting my work done and my boss was busy transitioning to a new role, no one checked on me. Talking online to friends and family only did so much. I shut down from the anxiety of sucking at my new job since training stopped 2 months in or being seen as redundant due to the pandemic and being fired. 

That never happened but I did find and start a new job 2 weeks ago that is a way better fit. We moved again and I thought this was a new beginning but Im stuck in pandemic mode. 

My brain feels shut down, its hard to read and retain information, and really get organized. I want to get out of it and just get back to me but Im afraid Im stuck this way. I really like the people and work but Im still struggling. 

Anyone relate? Anything work for you? I have tried to increase exercise, eating more and better, seeing a therapist but i havent had any relief. I thought getting a new job that had me in the office with better culture would help but I still rather stay in bed on my phone all day.

I work with kindergartners. Basically, while all the schools are closed down with parents still going out to work, the kids need to be supervised, and that's my job. I make sure each kid is attending their online classes, behaves, and entertain them until they get picked up. 

Today, I received a notice that a preschool separate from my location had multiple confirmed cases of COVID, and the siblings of these kids who attend my location are all quarantined. 

Cool, I guess. Close one, but at least there's a decentish chance I haven't been exposed. 

Then later in the day, one of my kids in my class (who was quarantined) was confirmed for COVID. I assume the last day of exposure was yesterday, 11/12/2020, but the notice I received says 11/10/2020. I don't know which kid it was, as my anxiety wracked mind cannot think straight to figure it out. 

I'm so scared. I have to get tested. My mom says that for the time being, I'll be all alone in the bedroom. I cannot leave the bedroom unless there's an emergency or I have been confirmed to be negative (I plan on getting tested twice if my first test is negative in case of a false negative). 

My kinders have no idea what's going on. We didn't tell them. They were all wondering why all the kids were leaving so early (my boss emailed every parent as soon as she got the news). They think we're coming back on Monday, but no. Our classroom is closed until the 24th at the very least. 

This isn't like the cold or anything I've ever been ailed with. This is the frickin coronavirus. I'm facing natural selection now. I'm 19, female, perfectly healthy with no underlying conditions. I can still die though. My mom and younger sister might have it too because I was the point of exposure. 

When this pandemic began, I feared that I was going to be the one to take it home, that I was going to be the reason why we're all going to suffer, that I was going to be the reason I put everyone at risk, that I was going to be the reason that someone could possibly die. 

I don't want to lose my mom or sister. I don't want to die and leave them and my amazing, amazing, absolutely the best thing that has ever happened to me boyfriend. He's worried about me. He tried to tell me to quit my job because I could always catch COVID twice, but I refuse. 

I love my job. This is my very first job and my boss is so kind and understanding. My job accomodates my college schedule and I get paid fairly well for it. I love my kinders with a burning passion and it hurts me to know that they probably have COVID too.

I guess I am just venting here because I have no one to talk to at this point.   I first got symptoms last Friday, and tested positive Saturday.    I have had the roller coaster of typical Omicron symptoms, but that's besides the point of this thread.    I am in my best friends wedding party.   The rehearsal is today and wedding tomorrow.   I called my buddy as soon as I tested positive last Saturday and explained the situation.   He is one who takes Covid very lightly, and he said ""Don't worry about it.  You will be fine.""   Come today, I still have a very bad cough and feel generally unwell.   As of this morning, I am also still testing positive (I have checked every day) on the home antigen tests.    I feel like it would be terribly irresponsible of me to go to a wedding, be in such close quarters with many people, while I still am testing positive.   I explained that to him a bit ago and he blew up on me.   I completely understand his feelings.  The guilt of letting him down is overwhelming me.

As a side note, I live with my 72 year old mother.   I have been successful on keeping her from getting Covid by isolating myself in a basement room this past week.    I have my own private toilet but no shower.   I would need to use the shower bathroom to get ready, and I am nervous interacting with spaces she uses while I am still testing positive.  I have worked so hard to keep her safe, and would suck messing that up at the end stretch.

All of this is triggering my anxiety like crazy.    I can't focus on anything, so I came here to vent.    Was I wrong to tell him I can't be in the wedding?  Should I risk breaking isolation and possibly getting my elderly mom sick?

5/21 - Update:  I wanted to thank everyone for their support.    It is the day of the wedding, and I just tested positive again on an antigen test.    My cough seems to gotten a bit worse,  I am very dizzy this morning, and also a bit achy.   This virus is damn strange.   Because of this  I will not be attending the wedding, but will be sending a gift and letter to my buddy.

My symptoms are so frustrating as I have just become more aware of them. One of them I recently recognized...whenever I have an actual moment of joy and laughter, like when visiting with my mother this past weekend...it was really great! Except...the positive feelings are EXTREMELY short lived and fleeting...it's like...painful in a way. It makes me so angry...so, so angry...so angry about feeling helpless and hopeless for so many months. Losing my support group of friends because over time, trying to stay in touch through phone and such DOES get exhausting on some level for many people similar to me with my stuff...because there is no flesh and blood human ELEMENT there to more strongly tie you in with these people you love and want to see.

All my mental illness stuff relapsed long ago when this stuff all started...I've been withdrawn and numb to ""cope"" on some level with the continuous passive suicidal thoughts. Even with my continuous take of my medication on time everyday, and my weekly therapy on the phone, and monthly phone check in with my psychiatrist...I miss having my appointments in person with them. They both kindly assure me that I am at the top of their list of clients to contact about seeing them in person when they can start seeing clients in person again, because I have been eager for human contact for months now. I'm fine with wearing a mask and distancing...I am fine with being last in getting a vaccine sometime because I am a very healthy person, as long as many others around me who are first are able to get theirs...I just...my main thing has been...I feel a very primal craving for flesh and blood social human interaction.

I've have too little interaction, and my need for it feels very primal. I hardly cry anymore like I did the first few weeks...but still, when I do, the emotional pain is utterly overwhelming, and I have to muffle my sobs into my pillows so my wailing isn't too loud. Then I feel drained and very thirsty afterwards...crying is thirsty ""work"" in a way...haha. I know it's good to have a good cry, I don't hold back my feelings...I know I am just numbed and withdrawn as my current coping mechanism.

I feel stable at the moment because I actually just ate something good...but...I dunno. I still feel trapped and uneasy. I am only even looking for commiseration and empathy. Validation and gentle words. How have any of you other people been doing with all of this stuff? Do you find yourselves also struggling with some symptoms from the pandemic stress?

I have been oddly happy to see that ""pandemic fatigue"" is now an entry on wikipedia. I don't know why, but that felt validating for me to discover. Check it out for yourselves...it's not only about the hard working health care workers, but everyday people who are trapped at home and indoors too much, and going stir-crazy.

I don't even want to talk to anyone anymore because my depression and anxiety are off the charts. 

My mom is 79 so I am delivering food to her but she is not thankful nor realizes that her favorite foods or supplies are not available now. She complains if I can't get her what she wants. Then she wants me to stay and hang out with her because she is lonely (we both wear masks). She also wants to buy a new car now during safer at home, even though she is getting dementia and shouldn't be driving anymore. She is totally irrational, difficult, and can't be reasoned with. 

My sister is a single mother and decided now to start dating someone during quarantine. She has been so careful this whole time not going out but now her caution went out the door when she met this new guy. Now she wants me to babysit my niece all the time while she goes on dates. There is no father in the picture and my sister said she can't get a babysitter because of the quarantine. =D Not only is she risking her health but my niece's as well. Her rationale is that he's been home too so he's not a risk. 

I am furloughed from work but my boss is giving us guilt trips if we don't come in and help her clean (for free) and get the place ready for when we open again. It's one of those ""we're like a family here"" businesses so she thinks we owe her. She only cares about reopening and not about the potential risks and how it's affecting everyone else. I really don't even want to go back to work and I've really enjoyed being off because it's such a toxic place but I feel like I have no choice but to go back because of the job market. Plus we deal with the public so I will have to wear a mask for 8 hours and risk getting infected by being around co-workers and clients. So far I haven't come in to help so I am getting the silent treatment now from her. 

Basically I feel like all I have in my life are manipulative narcissists who constantly take from me and have no empathy as to how this pandemic is affecting me or the rest of the world.

It's causing severe stress to an already stressful job, and the senders of these packages are oftentimes business owners. Because they're stressed due to the delay of packages thanks to COVID, they end up taking their frustration out on us. The word for today's post is 'stress' clearly.

Back in March, us CSRs were instructed to work from home and we have been ever since. While some people celebrate being able to WFH, I found that as someone with pre-existing anxiety and depression, the cler separation from work and home for me was needed to maintain my mental health. As I began working from home, it only took a few weeks for my anxiety and depression to become out of control - my apartment is extremely tiny, and I share it with my partner and cat. I unfortunately do not have a room I can lock myself in, so my cat ends up distracting me severely as she is quite needy and it messes with my productivity. Furthermore, because I take phone calls all day for my job, I've been told that my WFH arrangement also stresses out my partner as my headset can pick up the slightest noise and he can't behave like he normally does, needing to be quiet. So this arrangement doesn't only affect me but my family.

In a fit of desperation, I spoke to my doctor and she has prescribed me Prozac, which I actually seem to be acclimating to fairly well. However, the side-effects are a bit gnarly and that, along with everything else, is affecting my productivity. 

Working from home with my job has added a whole layer of complexity that is making me burnout and have breakdowns and depresive episodes in ways I never did when I was in the office. All I want to do is quit my job as I have enough for 3 months worth of bills saved up, but I know it might not be smart as who knows what the job market will look like in the future because of COVID.

Overall, my living situation (and myself) isn't suited for WFH, but my employer is giving me no other choice but to do this. For right now, we have no idea when we'll be back in the office, and that uncertainty is killing me even more. But I know if I quit, I won't get any ongoing unemployment benefits and my money will be gone in three months. My partner has already lost his job because of COVID, and is getting unemployment benefits but they are less than what he was making at his last job.

I am at a loss on what to do. My rational mind says it isn't smart to quit with only 3 months worth of savings under my belt, but I am suffering so tremendously that I'm not sure how long I ccan go on before having a full-on mental breakdown.","COVID19_support",7,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/grajwk/working_from_home_is_giving_me_severe_anxiety_and/"
"2022-02-20",1645367838,"Father critically ill in ICU, 5th day on the vent","What can I say? This is easily the most ruthless, cruel and devastating period of my life. My dear father, my best friend, relentlessly being taken away from me.

I know the odds are stacked against, nevertheless, I try my best to remain positive and today I have completed my 3rd day in a row of being alongside him in the ICU, just shouting at him to remain strong, that he is getting better, that well get through this and be more united and stronger than ever, saying that I love him and we need him, caressing his hand and hair.

Problem is when I crawl home and obsessively research ways to save him, whether its drugs or switching hospitals or whatever it is or I try to cling on to success stories that can give me some hope to carry on but they seem so few.

To add some context, my dad is 64, he is for the most part healthy, always had healthy habits, other than working too much and drinking some wine and his weight is within normal range. The problem is that roughly a year ago, his blood tests started to come back weird, with a very persistent anemia and off the charts white blood cell counts, especially monocytosis& some myelocytes and blasts were also detected in his peripheral blood.

Several tests after including bone marrow biopsies, myelograms and so on, the hematologists could tell his bone marrow was malfunctioning but couldnt absolutely diagnose him with CMML,perhaps because he wouldnt tick all the symptoms. Ive gone through as many documents my dad held about it and they always say CMML but under study. It is just very suspicious and infuriating why that doctor took so long to diagnose and procure him the best treatment. Perhaps he couldve already at least made some progress. 

In the meantime with this pandemic going on I told my dad countless times that not getting the vaccine was too risky, I even begged him to go and that I would accompany him if he was too scared about having an allergic reaction. I also advised him to avoid going out as much as possible and work remotely. Well he didnt listen but somehow we all managed to dodge this virus for nearly 2 years now.

With Omicron being prevalent now and the media being more optimistic he got a little too confident maybe and decided to take his chances with the virus. His lifestyle consisted in driving around a lot due to professional reasons and his girlfriend living far.

Early February he went to his girlfriends parents house for some sort of family gathering and now here we are with my dad in an induced coma since the morning of the 16th, on a vent and pneumonia on both lungs (50% compromised, dont know if that has changed though).

Docs say he is responding more or less well in terms of combatting the covid and the bacterial infection that had taken over his lungs but this whole doubt in regards to his leukaemia type is really not helping in terms of treatment and his organs are starting to struggle. I have been told they needed to stimulate his heart with some drug which they didnt disclose and his kidneys are struggling too but no dialysis is necessary yet.

I was with my father and I could see what drugs were being given through the automatic syringe pumps. Fentanyl, antibiotic, furosemide, lipids, noradrenaline are the ones I recall. 

What makes me kinda optimistic is that his vitals look good on the monitor and the vent is currently with a peep of 10 compared to the first time I saw him when it was at 12-15, oxygen concentration at 50% compared to former 80% and respiratory rate is at 22. 

He is also no longer prone at least since the 17th February. What does everyone think? Ill keep this thread as a journal. If anyone could help me I would be so thankful from the bottom of my heart. Because my dad has suspected CMML it is hard to find information regarding covid patients with this underlying issue.","COVID19_support",25,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/sx2le4/father_critically_ill_in_icu_5th_day_on_the_vent/"

Last shot was in November and I got Covid on the 2nd week of my vacation in the end of December. I had fever, chills, runny nose, sore throat, and my voice actually went away for 2 days. I thankfully had some Day/Nyquil and those helped me feel better. When I came home, I tested positive for Covid and went into isolation for a week. During isolation I felt fine. Didn't even have to take any meds, only symptoms of note was sometimes shortness of breath and waking up from coughing at night.

It's been a month since I tested negative and I feel worse than when I was in isolation. I get a fever at night, shortness of breath at night, sore throat lasting almost all day, my energy is gone too. It's driving me mad. Some days I feel alright and some days I feel like crap. Ironically at the beginning of February, I was saying how I felt like my old self and now I regret saying that. 

I'm tired of it. I just want to feel normal again. When it feels like I have a fever, I take my temperature and it turns out that I don't have one. I have to take my asthma meds at night when prior to Covid I rarely had to take them because if I don't I'll wake up in the middle of the night coughing/gasping for air. Thankfully the cough is gone...mainly.

"2021-01-12",1610460426,"My Story &amp; I got vaccinated!","Hey all! TLDR at bottom.

Im a registered nurse in Canada who was redeployed to work on a COVID unit. When the pandemic happened, I grew depressed and burned out. I was living alone at the beginning of 2020 and it was difficult being away from my partner, family, and friends. I couldnt do things that were therapeutic for me such as going to the gym or doing my martial arts classes... due to the lockdown. I took it seriously and didnt see anyone other than my colleagues. I felt isolated and alone... FYI Im an extrovert!

I was very anxious. I had panic attacks and everyday I felt some impending doom. I was crying a lot. When I wasnt working, I would sleep most of the time. I medicated myself to sleep because I was so anxious. I began taking benzodiazepines to manage my anxiety because it was so bad.

To be honest, I had thoughts of not caring. I wanted to give up and stop trying. I saw a lot of people not caring about the lockdown, social distancing, and wearing a mask. It got to the point where I questioned my passions. I thought maybe I shouldnt have become a nurse. I was so stressed. We were understaffed so the patient and nurse ratio wasnt good. Whats the point of being a nurse? Do people even appreciate us? I was on the verge of giving up...

But lets have a plot twist now! 

I got better. I got happier. I managed. I tried my best. I did all I could to take care of myself. Im a nurse. I need to be okay so I can take care of my patients. Helping people, especially vulnerable people, is my calling. I didnt want to give up. I didnt want to die. I wanted to keep going. 

Ill be honest... Im quite a resilient person. I also have an extremely supportive partner who moved in with me last year in the summer after we decided not to see each other for a while due to him living with someone at risk. I didnt see him for about 3 months. He played a huge role in helping me get back on track. I didnt feel alone anymore and I have someone here, smiling, when I come home from a shift.

Im lucky and fortunate. I know there are people in this world who are going through worse. Im sorry and I want you to know that things will get better. It just takes time. I know its cliche but I wanted to share my story. It took a bit over half a year until I was relatively okay and I didnt get my motivation back until last month. Slowly it surely... we all will be okay e I also got vaccinated two days ago :)

Edit: added some more things!

And Im sitting in my house with my husband. Other than him going to work (which is a semi safe office environment) he stays home too. I can tell were getting irritated with one another, but it feels like we dont have a choice. He personally had a friend die from covid who was only 30 years old. Ive had friends and family members of friends that have either died or gotten extremely ill and still have not recovered.

Today is the day #49 of quarantine, considering the day that on my workplace they send us home (And for those we can, work from home). However, technically my state Jalisco started to close up schooles, events, etc. since March 17, while at a federal state was to start on March 23.

However, i had to evade social networks a lot, since there's a huge rise on sickening stuff. Medical staff being assaulted, one hospital closed their doors 'cause people assaulted it since ""the medics are killing their families"" (but they say the Covid is a lie). In resume, the ignorance is too damm high!

A lot of people say that coronavirus doesn't exist since they know no one with the dissiease. But when i exampled the failure on that thinking, that on that terms, for me the VIH, Nacrocartels and world hunger didn't  exists since i know no people with VIH, no ""sicarios"" and no friend of mine died from starvation, i was told that was ""the stupidiest thing"". Simply, people want to believe they are right, and everyone else is wrong, even when you put the probes on their eyes.

I'm feeling tired, not 'cause of isolation (i had been somewhat introvert, i don't have a lot of friends, less those ones that go to party 24/7). What is getting me tired, is the lack of respect to others, that want to impose THEIR ideas.

We had been taking turns in my home to get what we need, and attempting to maximize efficiency (For example, i have to go to my workplace physically so i get my paycheck, so i use that to also get food or medicine we might require. At least when i go out, i notice a lot of people actually use face masks, respect the ""Sana Distancia"" so places are less crowded, and so go on on stuff that talks about being a responsible person.

However, days ago my mother went to get seeds and that kind of food since our ""reserves"" where going low... and she was MAD. Really mad! She told us that people at that market aren't trained to keep distance, even some of them where eating the food on place! A lot of failures that speaks about defficient to null training. Nothing compared to the ""Fresko"" (Is something like Walmart), where they even have ""checkpoints"" inside for the fruits and vegetables sections, and they mentioned that each night they sanitize the whole store.

Today a lot of people on my city where manifesting that the state goverment isn't allowing to open their comerces, even taking measures. And i understand them somehow, the boss on our job pawned 2 job trucks and mortgaged his house to be able to pay another month of half wages, since the workplace money reserves got totally empty! However, the comments on that post where: ""they have trucks that price over 17,000 usd they aren't starving, sold them and they will eat for a year""... so yes, they are the kind of people that believe anyone who has a better lifestyle don't have rights 'cause they are not poor.

I'm tired that a lot of people is stupid. I understand that the reality is diferent for everyone, that we must know the context to understand... but there's a lot of people that don't want to test the other's shoes, they simply want to believe they know more than a doctor or a scientist 'cause they watched some video on youtube.

On the bright side, while i have somehow a ""low"" number of contacts and friends, almost over 95% of them are actually people that is concius and don't believe bullshit at random. Even those ones who ""minimize"" the pandemic, and believe isn't so bad, still use facemasks and follow recomendations, respecting all those that believe.

But is sad to see a huge number of ignorant and dumb people everywhere. And sadly, thats one of the reasons why we have a such bad president today. And sadly, now i can confirm that is 'cause this kind of people why México is still a poor nation with a low quality of life. I understand a lot better why people risk their lifes for a poor but better quality life in the USA.

But well, in theory, in 10 days most stuff will start to work again taking special health measures (Is that, or risk a nationwide civilan war, or at least that's what i belive could happen).

To some, it means covid-19 is eradicated from the face of the earth, which doesn't actually have to happen for life to return to normal. From what people are saying on this sub, they feel run down by the concept of ""pandemic"" as much as any actual restrictions.

In October of 2020, I cancelled my travel home to see my family for the holidays. For months, I'd had in person indoor contact with exactly three other humans. Now,

* I get to see many all-vax friends regularly
* I feel safe at all-vax restaurants, movie theaters, and large parties
* I've got that dope booster immunity
* My family and the CDC all approved me going home twice, once for Thanksgiving and once for Christmas.
* Case counts may be high, but hospitals are not at capacity due to vaccines, improved treatments, and the actual virus getting milder

I'm looking forward to not feeling stressed in non-vax-controlled environments when someone coughs or doesn't mask properly. This is more about me than the pandemic, so I don't know when it will change.

Last I checked in I ended up talking to 3 doctors who wouldn't test me, but a week later I was still coughing and having trouble breathing which was new, so I called one of the doctors back, who said they would only see me if I was tested lol.

My mom found a place where I could get tested with a nasal swab, and it just came back - negative. They gave me a steroid inhaler which has helped my cough tremendously.

Not an expert here, but it seems like there are 3 possibilities:

a) I got COVID, but since I could not get a tested for 3.5 weeks, it was too late to get results, as my remaining cough was caused my asthma flared up by my irritated lungs.

b) I still have it and the test was a false negative (entirely possible)

c) I had some other virus but now my respiratory system is in a weakened state and I should be super paranoid until I recover fully

I just found out that someone from my work tested positive and we were in the building the same timeframe, I'm not sure if I was exposed.

I suppose the smart thing to assume I am vulnerable. The governor closed all restaurants and everyone is working from home so I suppose it will be easier.

I'm based in Israel but - judging by what I'm reading on Reddit and elsewhere - I'm pretty sure that this is a global dynamic.

I've pretty much avoided all unnecessary socializing since this began (which was relatively early - like Feb). I was initially freaked out because I have asthma. Then I calmed down a bit but I'm planning on keeping things up until I get the vaccine and regulations change, hopefully soon. To my mind, this is the only safe way to proceed.

I try to minimize social contact to the furthest extent possible. I go for jogs and pick up medications. But I won't visit anybody's house and, as much as I'd love to visit my original country (Ireland) this holiday season, I'm spending it away from family. I can't see how taking multiple air journeys right now is a justifiable risk.

I'm pretty sure that what I've done is like only the bare minimum recommendations for a pandemic. I could have been stricter. But I also reckon that 95% of people in my country have been much more liberal than this and would think that this is crazy.

I try not to judge other people for their behavior. Both because I realize that it's not my place and because I know that that anger will ultimately only hurt me. But being regarded as (what I call) a ""corona extremist"" (does anybody have a better term?) is getting really annoying. I would be embarrassed to tell most people why I didn't want to travel to Ireland this month and use work as an excuse!

I've always considered myself to be a fairly intelligent and well-reasoned person. I follow both the politics and world news pretty regularly and have always thought I'd done so in a dispassionate way without letting ideology guide my views and opinions.

When Covid hit I was sent out of the office to work from home on March 10 (where I remain). I read plenty of news from all different sources and I could see that even though I wasn't in an epicenter that this was still a pretty serious situation (I'm in Boston for the record and while it hasn't been NYC levels, we've certainly had our share). 

I didn't - and still haven't - adjusted well to working from home, but as I read and ingested plenty of news, facts, and commentary it was pretty easy for me accept what was going on and why we were taking the precautions we were. When crazy Uncle Jimmy posted the Plandemic video on Facebook it was pretty easy to cut through the bullshit. When nutty Aunt Alice posted about how nobody could tell her to wear a mask because FREEDOM it was pretty easy to say ""Hey, wait a minute. We're doing this because...""

I didn't have the energy to argue with them but I had no problem stating my own opinion, backing it with facts, and saying ""agree to disagree"".

Fast-forward a few more weeks and I'm afraid I'm getting beyond the point of merely understanding why someone might want to buy into a counter-factual narrative. I can still call BS when something is obviously BS, but I'm starting to find myself reading a little less critically. I catch myself cherry-picking facts to support the narrative I wish were true rather than the one my intellect tells me is true. I'm not articulating anything, spoken or otherwise, at this point but I'm starting to feel myself rolling my eyes and discounting things that I normally wouldn't. When my immuno-compromised wife says that ""looks like restaurants are opening next week, but I think we're going to wait a bit before heading back out"" I can feel a myself giving a mental eye-roll and thinking ""come on, everything's fine"".

The short of it all is that I seem to have lost the mental strength to look at the situation objectively and am instead starting to try and fit things into the narrative I want to see rather than the one that exists. Mostly it's internal, I'm not sharing wacky conspiracy stuff on Facebook and I'm not refusing to wear a mask into the grocery store...but that's today. I'm not sure where I'll be two weeks from now.

I'm hoping this is just Covid fatigue and I'll get over it, but I really feel as if I'm losing my ability to think critically about this situation and instead of cutting through the bullshit I'm starting to let it in and before long I'll be believing it. Whatever it is, I don't like the change I'm seeing in myself.","COVID19_support",11,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gz1w0t/has_anyone_else_felt_themselves_change_over_the/"

Im a 26/F registered nurse who has been working pretty much throughout the pandemic. I live alone and havent seen my boyfriend and close friends for nearly 10 weeks. Some days its easy and some days, such as now as I go to work... is hard.

Im a huge extrovert and I thrive in social interactions but its a bit different compared to only being able to see patients and colleagues.

I miss my boyfriend so much. He lives at home with his grandpa who is part of the at risk population. We make do with the distance by talking everyday (weve always talked everyday anyways) and by videocalling once or twice a week due to his work (he works from home). 

But I feel selfish because it isnt enough for me. Im growing more anxious and depressed as time goes by. People say treat this as a long distance relationship and yeah I get it but I have no social interaction outside of work. I just sleep because Im tired from work and Im depressed. When I was in a long distance relationship in the past, I had friends and family to spend time with to keep me sane.

TW: Ideation","I'm posting this here bc all the rant pages like ""off my chest"" and ""unpopular opinion"" won't let you post about COVID19, they just stick them on these megathreads where it gets lost and I feel even more lonely and unheard and suicidal so I'm sorry if this comes across as angry but I'm really freaking angry and scared shitless. 

I feel like every single time I post something on fb along the lines of ""stop shaming people for leaving their house when they can't work from home"" or ""service/arts/entertainment workers whose jobs were just cut have the right to be upset"" someone always comments something like ""it's not about you"" or ""people are dying"" or ""it's about society's most vulnerable"". Or ""social distancing may be a long term thing and we'll all just have to adjust"".

Like, um NO. How about you STOP. Unemployment in the USA just reached 20% a few days ago. Do you know how high that is?! During the Recession of 2009 it was 10%. WE'RE DOUBLE THAT!! During the Great Depression it was 24%. We are SO CLOSE TO BEING THERE and if/when retail shops all close WE WILL BE THERE!! Guess what--during the great depression there wasn't a virus going around, but a lot of people died because they KILLED THEMSELVES. Or STARVED TO DEATH. Because they had NO MONEY. But screw anyone who cares about that/them, right?! I mean SCREW THEM.

In what ridiculous opposite land universe are people living paycheck to paycheck, on jobs that don't have paid leave, not considered some of ""the most vulnerable among us""?! This ""the poor must starve so the elderly can live"" bullshit is UNBELIEVABLY inhumane (yes, I know it doesn't just affect the elderly but service/gig workers are still supposed to ""adjust"" to not having jobs anymore). Guess what, Karen, with your cushy white collar 9-to-5 that lets you work from home and gives you health insurance and your husband and kids and pets that give you additional support you get to stay at home with--GET OFF YOUR HIGH HORSE.

2% of the US population versus 20% of the US population--TEN TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE are at risk of starving to death as will suffocate to death over the next year. And gun to my head? I'd rather suffocate. By far. None of this is to say we shouldn't be concerned about the elderly and immunocompromised, we should, but myself and all of my friends are young, healthy, creative gig workers who up to one month ago had beautiful bright futures ahead of them and expected to live a long time. Literally everyone I consider a close friend is, sorry WAS, in food service/arts/entertainment. And everyone, save one person, lost their jobs. I'm lucky. I come from a line of good, highly educated New York Jewish stock, and though I'm financially independent I have backup if I need it. Most of my friends aren't so lucky. And I worry about them dying, but not from coronavirus. 

For that matter, I don't do well in isolation. At all. I know I'll kill myself if there's a lockdown and I have to live alone in my apartment for more than 3 days--all my roommates are home with their families, and my mom wants me home because she knows I'm like this. But my sister and dad are immunocompromised and my sister also has asthma and I've only been social distancing for like 3 days, in Manhattan of all places. I can't risk it. And every time I'm on social media it's people just being MEAN and HATEFUL. The irony is, I know I'll get COVID19. I know I'll survive. Because I'd really be fine with dying and that's how the universe works. I feel so lost. 

I think if one more person says ""people are dying"" to me after I've been sobbing and shaking nonstop for 4 days, I'm gonna slice up my arm. Or hang myself. I'll have plenty of time to refine the plan. Because even when there isn't a pandemic, I think about people I care about dying every single day. It's like a constant thought. It's hard to see the light on the other side. I'm supposed to turn 27 in early June. I probably won't make it that far.

I danced with a mask on most of the time but got anxious because my cousins new husbands family is anti-vax.

I entered this pandemic as an eighteen year old about to graduate from high school and I'll come back to ""normality"" as a twenty something year old who has never even gone to a party or kissed somebody.

I can't even go for a walk outside without fearing being assaulted, raped or murdered because crime is very bad here and my parents are also very paranoid, which I understand, but it doesn't help.

Life changed for everyone in march. 
I was born and live in northern France but never having complicated relation with my family, i met two people in the UK who over time became my ""other"" family. 

I had a nice routine, once or twice a month visiting them for the week-end or a few days. It's so close with the channel tunnel. 
It was my ""home"", a safe place where i could relax.

Then it stopped. When travel was allowed again for a few weeks this summer, people wanting to go holiday rushed to buy tickets and it was 6-7 times the normal price, i couldn't afford that. 

Then quarantine arrived &amp; i cannot afford due to my job to spend two weeks in UK quarantine just for a visit. 

I kept telling myself ""it'll be over soon; we have been through the worse of it already, it's just a matter of weeks now"". I didn't look at the number or the news. 

When they announced they were closing the France-Belgium border again last week, i just broke down. 
It's far from over...

I have managed to hang on for 6 months of this already. Realizing it could go on for one more year (if not more) just destroyed me.

At the beginning of the pandemic (March/April/beginning of May), my whole company worked remotely from home. As the situation in my country more or less stabilized, we were informed that if we give notice to HR ahead (for them to arrange safe working conditions), we can starting coming back to the office (but it was voluntary).

I was thrilled, because I was going crazy at home. I arranged with my manager that I will work some days of the week in the office, and some from home, to kinda ease myself in. I thought I will feel better once I go back to familiar routine (normal day activities, wearing make-up and nice clothes, just generally not being stuck at home), but... I was wrong.

PRACTICALLY NO ONE ELSE came back to the office. Everyone is just chilling at home, all pleased that they don't have to commute. I don't know how can they stand it for so many months. So instead of feeling better, I feel even worse, because now that I'm going to a weirdly empty office, I feel even more isolated ironically.

I miss office parties and integration outings, that we used to have. I miss talking to people. I miss hugging my mom (she works in medical field so we have little contact in order not to endanger each other). I miss going out to a bar, or just casually shopping. I don't do... anything... right now. Nothing. I don't see people, I don't go places. And this situation is not changing, not getting better. The virus is not going away. Now soon, kids are about to go back to school, and that + upcoming autumn/winter season... well, I have bad feeling about it. I'm scared it will get worse.

At the same time, I see that various events (e.g. concerts, conventions), are being moved to 2021. Why... do people assume it will get better just because we switch a page in the calendar? People are being idiots, not wearing masks, not ""believing"" in the virus (oh my God...), clearly it's not getting anywhere near the end, so idk why everyone seems to think as soon as this year ends it will just get better.

Not having anything else to do, I really invested myself in my work (i also got a promotion in April, so I consider myself very lucky, in those unstable times, which only makes me more dedicated). And recently, I had a couple of days when I felt unwell, and panicked a bit that I might be getting sick. My first thoughts? That I will let my co-workers down, that I won't fulfill my duties. Logically it seems to me that I should worry about myself, my safety and health, but all I can think of is that if I got sick, I would have remorse regarding letting my job down. It's insane.

I hate everything that is happening now, and everything that I'm feeling. My year's resolution was to lose weight, but now I don't even care, what's the point? No point doing anything anymore.

I'm afraid of getting infected or getting others infected. I'm ever more afraid of being confined to my home again. I live alone in a small flat and the lockdown in March and April, being unable to see my friends and family, was unbearable. During the summer, the virus pretty much slowed down and everything seemed to be maybe not back to normal, but on its way there. I was hoping I will be able to work from the office again before the end of the year.

Not the virus is back with a vengeance, my country's pitiful healthcare system is already overwhelmed and the amount of new infections is mounting nearly every day. We're on ""soft lockdown"", which is pretty much a bunch of random lockdown measures slapped together to make it seem we're doing something about COVID-19. The risk of getting sick is now real and I can't mentally afford to sequester myself in my apartment and wait for the end of pandemics.

Everything is so tiring right now. Having a walk now means having a sheet of damp paper or cloth on my face and barely seeing anything through fogged glasses. I don't know why do I even bother, half of the people I see don't wear masks anyway or leave their noses uncovered. Cashiers in shops wear them on their chins.

Visiting anyone (right now only my parents, my brother and the same group of friends) makes me afraid I may be sick and possibly infecting them. I have a deviated septum, which routinely causes me rhinitis and sinus problems. It's a nightmare right now, because hoarseness or runny nose could be the first symptom of COVID-19. I check my temperature every day (in fact, every several hours). Last night, I was convinced I lost my sense of smell until it turned out I just worked myself into believing that. Anxiety-related disease symptoms were always a problem for me and the current situation is a perfect breeding ground.

The media is now unbearable, just a parade of sad and scary news. I turned Facebook notifications off, because it was pretty much more of the same. It's hard to block out every mention of the disease anyway and I feel unprepared if I don't read at least a bit. Then a bit becomes a lot and I inevitably find some terrifying news: reinfections, crippling permanent effects, overworked medics, etc.

I miss the period of my life when even when it was crappy, I could hope it was at least going to be better. Now it's just waiting for the other shoe to drop. Will someone I know get sick and die? Will I get sick and die? Will there be another hard lockdown and am I going to spend a month or two in an empty apartment? Will there be Christmas, or am I going to spend them alone calling my family through Zoom like it was a sprint planning (""I can't hear you, can you hear me?"")?","COVID19_support",10,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jdn6ha/feeling_tired_and_helpless/"

I am personally not too worried for myself. I am not at high risk. None of the people that I live with are. I have been doing everything I can to be sure I don't contract anyway. My boyfriend is high risk, but he loves out of state and we are sticking to phone calls for however long we know that this is an issue.

We've got people who demand that we wear masks, that we sanitize more than an understaffed convenience store possibly could. We've got people complaining about the customer limit, the lack of product that we temporarily can't sell, etc.

I work as a security guard in many different types of security. And therefore, yes, I'm still out there almost every day, I'm still working and I'm doing it for the benefit of hopefully everyone. Now, I'm not saying that I'm as important as a person in the medical field or someone who is keeping the food distribution working but our jobs become more important and meanwhile more exhausting (at least mentally) every day. And while yes, more people nowadays stop and thank me personally for my work etc. I still feel that we and the police are under appreciated these days.

I am in front of hospitals and enforce the no visitors rule and send people with symptoms to a separate area. I stand in front of grocerie stores and pharmacies and ensure that not too many people enter. I am at the train stations and make sure that groups no bigger than 5 people are hanging out and sending them away etc. And I'm not doing that because I have fun to be the ""no fun police"" or because I like to make peoples lifes more difficult but because it is important right now and because people are too stupid to follow these rules by themselves. And yes, most days I'd rather stay at home the whole day and watch TV or play games and isolate myself from the risks but I don't because someone has to do that job and hopefully it helps us to return to normality just a little bit faster.

And yes, these days it hurts especially when someone just curses at me or doesn't follow the rules just because they are stupid and he wants to party or whatever. Because normally he wouldn't cause big harm, maybe of me a little bit and some other people there but now that ahole is hurting everyone be being a selfish idiot. So please everyone, next time you see a security guard doing public work to keep everyone just a little bit safer, just try to be thankful. Not only now but also when this thing is over.

It's scaring the shit out of me considering I had an extensive history of childhood respiratory problems and seasonal asthma, despite otherwise being a healthy 21 year old female. 

My family living in central Florida has been asking me to come back, but so many factors make me question if I should return.

For one, air travel. Is it even safe anymore? Despite being only $18 for a one way ticket, I'm seriously terrified of even going near an airport. It's terrifying even going outside... so many people aren't taking this seriously, talking in groups and COUGHING ON EACH OTHER right in the streets and causally continuing their conversation, or kids playing tag and soccer in the park, not to mention the increase in race-related hate crimes and hostility (I'm Chinese)... wtf y'all

I'm also scared that I'm possibly asymptomatic and might be bringing it back home, infecting my dad in his 50s or my 19 y/o immunocompromised brother. Learning that males have a nearly 2x higher death rate made me rethink if I should even be in the same house as them. 

My mom is a respiratory therapist working in Florida, also in her 50s. I'm not on good terms with her and cut her out of my life in my teens, but yet I'm still deathly worried knowing she'll likely catch the virus and will be working without proper safety gear. My 29 y/o sister is a doctor as well, primarily working in the ICU. Even if she's young, I'm hearing cases of young doctors her age falling seriously ill just from being around so many infected patients. It just feels like my entire immediate family is all at a higher risk and it's doesn't feel fair at all.

It feels like there isn't really a right choice for me to make. I've been debating for days on if I should just buy the damn ticket or not, and I really wish all this bullshit would just blow over.","COVID19_support",33,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fn1soy/being_too_scared_to_escape_nyc/"
"2022-01-05",1641411347,"I Hate Being in this Weird Limbo","Last Thursday I woke up sick. Testing was already extremely hard to get in my Province; most places were appointment only and completely booked up. The few that were walk-ins had wait times of like 4-6hours. But of course it's been recently switched to only be available to those working in places like healthcare, longterm care, etc. So I'm totally out of luck. 

Up until yesterday I had a headache, painfully dry nose/sinuses, a sore throat, and fatigue. No coughing, my temperature was 37°C (on average I'm around 36.5), I'm eating fine. As of today I'm a lot better and really only dealing with some congestion.  

I'm just so frustrated that I have no way to find out if it's actually Covid. But also, the officials keep changing the guidelines.

Luckily my job is Work from Home, and although I've been visiting my dad the past month, his place is big enough I can still sufficiently quarantine (which I've been doing since my symptoms started). 

There's been a bad cold going around my town (not covid, I know people who were sick but tested negative multiple times through their work). just hate not knowing for sure.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19\_support/comments/gpztvy/weekly\_good\_news\_sticky\_2531\_may\_2020/](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gpztvy/weekly_good_news_sticky_2531_may_2020/)

It has to go away because we can only sticky two posts at a time and we need to let you know about some new rules.

**THE NEW RULES - Offer support, not opinions**

**ANYONE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO JOIN 'END LOCKDOWN' PROTESTS, RIOTS OR OTHER CIVIL ACTION ON THIS SUBREDDIT WILL BE IMMEDIATELY BANNED.** 

Over the last couple of weeks, some discussions on this sub have started to get political and sometimes heated. There is a broad spread of people here - as there are in real life - who sit somewhere along a spectrum of risk-taking behaviour. But rather than being evenly distributed along that spectrum, there seems to be a tendency to cluster towards one end or the other. Those at both extremes seem to be offering their opinions to posters who didn't ask for them and starting arguments which seem to be more about getting their views across than offering helpful advice. It has to stop. It is not fair on the vast majority of users here who want support and advice for specific situations and contexts.

From now on, we will be removing posts that are not asking for emotional support and advice for specific situations (or offering resources to help people with the current situation) and any replies that do not address the OP's primary concern. For example, if an OP is worried because their nextdoor neighbour had a BBQ and two of the guests passed within a metre of an open window the OP was standing behind, help them to understand how likely it is they were infected - do not give an opinion that it's high time BBQs were allowed again or that their neighbour is a selfish asshole who is going to kill people. If an OP is worried because their cafe business is going bankrupt, offer them advice on where they can find help with financial management or anxiety attacks, don't tell them they're selfish to have wanted to keep the cafe open or that the people who won't let them open up are selfish for causing so much anxiety and bankruptcy. Just try to help them with their current situation.

It is extremely important, for everyone's mental and physical health that we do not polarise, politicise and and misrepresent this situation. We will all get through this by keeping firmly to the middle ground: not extremes.

The lockdowns HAVE been necessary. They HAVE saved countless lives across the world. Many people DO find them difficult, emotionally and financially and DO wish they were over. The most extreme lockdowns are now being eased, slowly and cautiously across most countries - see the stories I have been posting every week in the Good News sticky of (mostly European) countries starting to open up and go back to something more like normal. In the last two weeks, for example, the UK (where I am) has eased some lockdown restrictions so that more people have been able to go back to work, are able to meet up with friends and relatives in open spaces such as parks, visit beaches and outdoor beauty spots and play sports such as tennis, golf and basketball outdoors. Next week, schools reopen for some pupils and, if this proves to be as safe as it is expected to be, more will go back during the next three week period, when some non-essential shops will also reopen. Lockdown will not last forever. Nor is it right to end all lockdown restrictions tomorrow.

The leisure industry and tourism industries will reopen. But these plans have to go slowly. Rushing things, and causing a second spike that leaves hospitals overwhelmed again will only lead to more deaths. Italy, which has one of the world's highest case fatality rates, is thought to have been hit so badly because it was caught unawares and many people died because hospital capacity was overwhelmed. Countries that have been affected later have the opportunity to learn lessons and keep more of their populations alive.

Please avoid extreme opinions and views and keep them off this sub.

NO ONE on this sub should say that going for a jog or a run is killing people.

NO ONE on this sub should imply that it is easy for people to stay at home for three months without income, hugs or social interaction.

NO ONE on this sub should claim that suicides during lockdown are killing more people than COVID19 would kill if we just ended them tomorrow.

The reality lies in a reasonable and rational middle ground where some measure of restrictions on daily life is necessary to save as many lives as possible with recognition that those restrictions are not easy, and do cause some people real issues - this sub exists to help them cope with those issues.

We cannot - and will not - have people on this sub pushing political narratives, in either direction.

This sub is for people's \*personal\* experiences and difficulties during the outbreak. Replies should help and support that person through their difficulties.

Please don't let it descend into politics and pushing particular (often political) agendas. We do not have time as moderators to constantly debunk BOTH over-extreme ends of a spectrum. Anyone who seems to be more interested in pushing their point of view, attacking other users for having a different one or bringing up policies/politics not directly related to the post will have their posts and comments removed. Persistent offenders risk being banned.

Please, enjoy the sub and be kind to one another.","COVID19_support",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gqlqfc/new_rules_on_sub_discussion_plus_link_to_weekly/"
"2021-11-05",1636128554,"I'm a Tinnitus sufferer who is Vaccine hesitant - advice please","I want to start this off by saying that I am very much pro vaccine. In January this year I got Tinnitus from noise damage. I then started going on Tinnitus forums including Reddit's own Tinnitus community. I was worried by reading various threads about the covid Vaccine either giving people Tinnitus or making people's pre-existing Tinnitus worse.

On these threads it seemed most times to be a 50/50 split on if the vaccine had affected their Tinnitus or not. I know that the chances of the vaccine affecting my Tinnitus are much, much less that 50%. Unfortunately after reading some of these threads it did scare me and I became vaccine hesitant and have yet to be vaccinated. As I can work from home I'm able to avoid people quite easily, but this year the only socialising I have done has been outdoors. Obviously with the winter months just around the corner this is no longer a practical option.


I checked with the mods if it would be ok to post this topic here. The reason I am posting here rather than on Reddit's Tinnitus community or a Tinnitus forum is that Tinnitus specific communities tend to attract those who are struggling with their issues and often become negative echo chambers. As a result they tend to attract negative responses especially where the vaccine is concerned and aren't reflective of the true chances of the vaccine affecting Tinnitus.


Basically what I'm looking for is some positive reinforcement and to give me that final push to get vaccinated. I am aware that the chances of covid making my Tinnitus worse are higher than the vaccine doing so. As Tinnitus is quite a common issue I imagine that there must be people who have it who are members of this support community. So if any Tinnitus sufferers could post which vaccine they had and if it affected their Tinnitus I would be very grateful, even if it did affect their Tinnitus negatively as I want as honest an assessment as possible.

Thank you

EDIT - I'll be honest this thread isn't going how I hoped and expected it would. Five people have said the vaccine hasn't affected their Tinnitus whilst two people have said the vaccine has given them Tinnitus and another said their hearing wasn't affected (but didn't state whether or not they had Tinnitus).

SECOND EDIT - Todays responses have been a lot more reassuring with the tally now: 
No effect on Tinnitus - 13 
Afffected/caused their Tinnitus - 2

THIRD &amp; FINAL EDIT - Booked in for my shot on Thursday!

"2022-04-07",1649361746,"Still afraid of Covid 19 even after vaccines!","The title says everything. 

I got the vaccines last September and sincerely, it did feel better but it didn't make me go back to normal. Meaning, I was still so afraid that I avoided applying for jobs and refused to go to interviews (I had some interviews planned but cancelled all of them).

What made me so afraid is seeing and hearing of my friends who got the shot and the booster and STILL got the virus (some got a mild version, others were bedridden). It pisses me off that they couldn't have made a vaccine with higher protection from the virus. There is nothing reassuring about the vaccine for me atm and I'm not sure if getting the booster will help (I should get it this April or May).

BUT, I am so tired of sitting at home and avoiding life. I go out often but don't socialize with anyone. I go to the library and parks/green areas. Crowded places are the worst for me so I avoid those like the plague.

I also want to say I have GAD and used to get frequent panic attacks. I also have an untreated health anxiety and OCD. It's genetic.

My mindset is this: if I start living normally, I'll get the virus and it's gonna be bad for me-even worse than those close to me that had it. 

How are people coping with extreme Covid anxiety even after being vaxxed and/boosted? For those who were very afraid and got the jab: did you manage to get back to a routine? (office work, spending time with friends, meeting new people, going to clubs, etc) What tips do you have for someone like me?

Thanks in advance.

UPDATE: I went out and had a few in person job interviews. Interacted with many strangers and I didn't get overly anxious. Of course, it was stressful but I got over it. I'll keep doing this and hopefully, the anxiety will lessen in time. Thanks for all your advice. Talking openly about this helped me see that Covid anxiety is normal. :)","COVID19_support",55,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/tylgfj/still_afraid_of_covid_19_even_after_vaccines/"
"2021-01-13",1610573850,"Im scared and could use some kindness.","Covid-19 hit me a lot harder than I ever thought. Ive always been the type of person who works hard and pushes through no matter what. But Im really tired. Im so tired. In additional to the virus, theres been racial injustice, political issues, and more... its insane. Ive kept these feelings internal however. My parents and sibling dont believe me when I tell them how overwhelmed I feel. They always tell me it was a good year despite everything that happened and sure I wasnt laid off from work, I got a new cat, and I moved homes. But, is it really so wrong of me to still feel despair? 

To top it off my job has been progressively worse for my mental health. Ive worked throughout this entire pandemic. At the start of the pandemic half our staff were given the opportunity to work from home but our essential staff needed to stay in office. I was one of them. I work in healthcare and Im constantly exposed to patients in the office  a lot of them elderly due to my line of work. Its been hard for me to function. I want to pretend things are okay and work like everythings normal but its not. Our management keeps us in the dark about whats going on. Several coworkers were laid off or quit. With no replacement. We were given more work with no compensation. Our thank you gift for working throughout the pandemic was a mug. A freaking mug. When I tried voicing my concerns about becoming overwhelmed to HR I was directed to talk to my manager(who I strongly dislike because he is condescending and unsupportive) I spoke to him and I was told to stick with the job because he thought it would be good for my growth. That did not help. It was my final straw with this company. Every day feels exhausting and I come home crying. My resolution for 2021 was to look for a new job to fix my mental health. 

Im really slow at finding a new job at the moment but Im making progress. I have had a couple responses. Im now feeling guilt for wanting to leave my job because there are some coworkers who I genuinely like and would hate to dump the extra work onto them. Especially when Im one of the leaders on our team. I know I have to do whats best for me but I hate leaving them in that condition. The lack of communication, training, and leadership makes this job feel like hell. I need to leave this job to be happy again. I feel so much resentment from this place and Im afraid it will change me as a person if I continue to stay. 

Im scared starting over. I have to take care of all my finances by myself and Im worried I cant afford everything if a new job doesnt offer me enough. I know Im a capable worker but I also lack a lot of self confidence. I managed to get promoted 3 times at my current job because of my job performance so I know that Im capable of doing good things. But because of the poor management at this job, Im worried and weary about starting somewhere new. I dont want to experience feeling worthless anymore. I keep psyching myself out of it that its hard to sleep. 

I really need to be kinder to myself. Especially in this pandemic. I just have a hard time telling myself that Im doing the right things. I feel like Im caught in a weird abusive relationship with myself where Im convincing myself to remain working at my job cause its not that bad. 

I could use some reassurance.

First a little about the situation. In my province we have mandates around vaccination. Basically non-essential services like the movies or a restaurant you need proof of vaccination to get in.

Now a story about us. We met at a shitty job roughly 10 years and and have been great friends since. We been through so much together. We even left the shitty job at the same time to return to school and upon graduation we both got great jobs paying a lot more then our old job did. We had careers and good ones.

My friend (Who I will name Nick) has done so many good things after this happened. Bought a house and got their life settled. Things seemed to be going well. However COVID came along and as we all know COVID has been hitting all of our mental health a bit. Nick wasn't even anti mask he supported using them.

But when vaccines came along. Nick got a bit defensive. He refuses to get the COVID vaccine at all. This is crippling his life. He is about to lose his career and well paying job because vaccines are mandated where he works. Without that income him and his gf (who is also losing her job due to vaccination status) will most likely lose their home. I been watching Nick slip deep into a black void as each week goes on. Losing friends that he had had and their job and possibly their home is devastating. I been trying to offer support but what more can I do? I can offer guidance but how can you guide someone who's only real option is to get a vaccine to get their job back and things they enjoy doing but refuse to do so? I am pro choice but it's hard to advise Nick on the right thing to do as really the right thing should be what he feels comfortable with but it's at the cost of his quality of life.

I also have been feeling guilty. Life has been awesome for me. Just bought a brand new car and got a nice raise at work. It's hard to share in triumphs when friends are suffering in defeat. I don't know how any of you would handle this...if there was a way. But I am open ears.

"2020-11-08",1604874462,"For those mentally struggling, as I am, with everything going on and changing every day","I know everyone is dealing with different situations in terms of lock down, stay at home orders, etc.  I know I am not the only one who was been immensely depressed and broken mentally.  From being SO so so almost unbearably lonely, to not being able to get out of bed, to breaking down crying constantly from either news outlets, loved ones getting COVID, etc etc, it's been really rough to find the motivation to do anything.  So I came up with three lists that I have in a notebook, ready for me whenever I start feeling down.  On three separate pieces of paper I have ""Ways To Make Money"", ""Ways To Stay Busy And Happy"", and ""Ways To Be Active"".

All three lists are things I can do from home and that I have immediate access to!  I make sure my notebook is visible on my desk at all times, so whenever I get even the slightest sense of a depressive episode coming on, I can grab it and get started immediately :)

On ""Ways To Make Money"" I also list ways to HELP me make money (certain ways I can be more organized with work, cleaning my work space, creating work ""goals"", etc).  ""Ways To Stay Busy And Happy"" are just small hobbies or things I'd like to start doing, as well as therapeutic activities like cleaning or doing my makeup.  ""Ways To Be Active"" speaks for it itself, but I have listed specific exercises or different routes to take on a walk.

I also want to add I think it's important to be somewhat specific as well!  At least for me that's what works :)  Because I know I get overwhelmed if I see ""baking"" (for example) instead of having ""bake an apple pie"", in my brain it just makes it easier.  I don't know if that makes a lot of sense, but it really does help to have a specific task you can tackle ASAP.

"2020-04-28",1588105566,"For those still anxious about coronavirus, just remember, the worst has passed","You may have heard the news, the United States just passed one million cases yesterday. It may seem hopeless, especially when the news media keeps on spinning the most negative stories. But I recently checked back on worldometers and other statistic websites to see where we were, and let me just say, I've never been happier during this pandemic then now.

Bottom line, things are getting better, and the peak is near

Yes, yesterday the US passed one million cases, but also on that day, the US reported over 23,000 new cases. That may sound like a lot, but throughout this month, the mean has been between 30,000 and 35,000, sometimes spiking above on the worst days.

This is the lowest number of new cases since March.

And it's a very, very good sign. It might possibly be a lull, but with a decline this drastic, paired up with the high amounts of new cases we were seeing just a few days ago, likely coming from testing increases, and I have a feeling we may finally be starting to see the situation get better.

Moreover, people are recovering. And whilst the amount of people actually infected and have died might actually be higher, the amount of recoveries is also actually much higher than reported. This is because most cases are minor, and after they test positive for the virus, many don't go back once symptoms have cleared up. You can notice a discrepancy in some states. Most notably, some states, like Louisiana, Tennessee, South Carolina, have much lower active cases compared to their total, and this is not due to high death rates, but because they're reporting the recoveries. In fact, in Louisiana, there's more people that have recovered than who still have the virus. Considering how Louisiana has some of the highest and most accurate testing rates of any state in the country, chances are the rest of the US might actually be in this position. Once we DO start seeing those recoveries being reported, then you will see the US peak in active cases. And I have every reason to believe the peak for not just the US, but the pandemic as a whole, will be in just a few days. It may very well happen this week. I'm keeping my fingers crossed on that.

Not only that, but many countries have already passed their peak of the pandemic, especially in Europe. Spain, Italy, Turkey, Ireland, etc. have all reached their peaks. The worst is over for them. And this is increasingly happening to other countries too. There's other statistics that are reassuring. For example, we are having more recoveries now than we've ever had. On April 24th, even though that day reported more new cases than any other day of the pandemic, at a staggering over 100,000 people infected, it also reported the most recoveries, with over 68,000. Not only that, but the amount of people reported in critical condition is dropping too. It peaked at just under 58,700 on April 23rd. Now we have 56,300. That number should continue to drop over the course of the pandemic. Lastly, the reported outcomes of the pandemic. The fatality rate should be expected to be between 0.7 and 4%, according to scientists, but the outcome graph has looked different for a while, because with so many new infections, many of them started to die. The peak appeared to be on April 10th, when just 78% of people who had an outcome recovered. 22% died. Those figures are beginning to look much better. 81% recovered, 18-19% dead. We should see these figures continue to space out as this pandemic continues, but it does recede. I also want to remind you that deaths have long peaked. The highest number of the whole pandemic was on April 17th, when over 8,000 people died. Yesterday, just over 4,500 people died, which is significantly less. And as with new cases, April 26th saw just over 3,700 people die, again, the lowest since March. In the US, the peak of deaths was last week on April 21st, when a little under 2,700 people died. Yesterday, however, it was just under 1,400.

Not only is this lining up with the popular IHMO predictions, which states things should've gotten much better by now, but the situations seems to actually possibly be going BETTER in some cases compared to the projections. They predicted over 1,700 deaths yesterday in the US, but as previously mentioned, it was just under 1,400. For New York, the most badly affected state, they predicted that 325 people were going to die in New York yesterday, and whilst it was actually a little higher, considering the last reported death figure was 501 deaths on April 25th, it shows things are getting better as they predicted. And as for the UK, which they apparently have very bad predictions for, with over 1,200 people dying yesterday, it was actually just 360 according to Worldometers. Assuming trends continue, and all countries affected hit their peaks and then see declining active cases, we should reach a point close to when things started really going downhill in mid-March sometime in mid-June. By then, social distancing will likely have been greatly relaxed, most people who wanted a test will have gotten a test and the best-case scenario, treatment is available that will make the virus significantly less fatal.

And social distancing will eventually need to stop, not just for people's sanity. Even though he's been most wrong about the virus, Donald Trump has a point in saying that we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem. I remember watching a video about Ebola's impact on Africa, and they mentioned how the economic impacts of the virus might've actually killed more people than the virus itself. Chances are, this could very well happen, especially the longer we continue having the economy shut down. That's why I anticipate in the next few weeks, likely sometime in May, you will start seeing social distancing and lockdown policies be relaxed in most of the developed world, including the US. We can't do it now, and it likely won't happen this or even next week, but sometime in May, I anticipate you may start being able to actually talk to others and hang out again, if in a limited capacity. And they will get further relaxed over the course of the summer. Though some like Dr. Fauci claim of a second wave similar to the Spanish flu, we have to remember this ISN'T the flu, it's a coronavirus. A second wave might not happen, especially if we do this right. Remember, SARS, which COVID-19 is similar to, did not have a second wave, it just had THREE reported cases in 2004 and then that was the end of it. COVID-19 obviously isn't going to be like that, but whilst a second wave definitely shouldn't be a possibility to rule out, it may not even happen, so having plans for fall shouldn't automatically be dashed because of what you heard on the news. I'm saying this as China is starting to reopen everything and they haven't reported any sudden spikes of cases like some have feared. In fact, new cases and active cases is only further decreasing. Even if it were to decrease, they would now have the resources and knowledge to deal with it, and much like all of us, we wouldn't have to resort to lockdowns or stay-at-home orders to deal with it. With extensive testing, sanitation, and a prohibition on large gatherings (so you still may not see conventions and sports over the summer, but you could do most of your summer vacation stuff if you wanted to, granted, you may not be able to travel anywhere outside the country), we can have it to where life is effectively close to normal, whilst still having the virus in a manageable position. We're not going to be able to eradicate the virus this year, it's already infected way too many people, but we can make it much more manageable to where life can continue in a relatively normal capacity. It's been infecting tens of thousands of people this month every day across the world. If we can get those numbers down to the thousands or hundreds place, it'll be much easier to deal with, and life and the economy will be able to continue like normal.

Whilst everyone is trying to predict the future of the pandemic, we have to remember that ultimately, if you really think about it, viruses behave a lot like gases. My 7th grade biology teacher gave this analogy: someone farts in a room, nobody notices it at first, then it spreads, and they smell it, others begin noticing it too, until it covers the whole room, but then, over time as it is spreading across the room, it is dispersing, where as it spreads out, it covers less space, because the volume increases but the mass stays the same. Obviously, viruses kill, farts can't, so it's not exactly the same, but it works essentially the same, as you'll notice if you studied any other pandemic. It spreads across every country it can, infecting everyone in sight. When the virus runs out of hosts to infect, it burns out, it  disperses, and even much like the fart you let it, it no longer becomes noticeable to anyone. Even if it is still physically lurking around, others have become preoccupied with other things as other gases take the original gases prevalence. The same goes with this current pandemic. Eventually, less people become infected, it becomes more sporadic, people become more interested in other things beside the virus as fears lessen, and eventually, people move on. This will likely go down in the history books, but soon, this pandemic will become just that, history. Maybe a lesson for leaders to look to, to avoid the same mistakes. Maybe people will listen to science more and stop blindly putting their faith in incompetent politicians and the system.

The effects of the virus are going to linger well after the peak. People will still get infected, some businesses will stay closed, some places like Disney World will stay closed, sports may not be on for a while, and most notably, the economy. The worst year for Liberia during the Ebola epidemic was NOT in 2014 when it was at its worst, but rather 2016. It's entirely possible for some countries, 2020 will not be the worst year for the economy. In order to make sure these impacts are minimized, people and leaders and scientists must stay vigilant. For as long as the possibility of infection remains, scientists must keep researching, politicians must have their plans, our resources must be kept, for whatever comes next, we have to stay vigilant.

But ultimately for what comes next, things are going to get better. Life will likely re-open AT THE ABSOLUTE EARLIEST in mid-May, but it probably won't be until June. But the good news is the light at the end of the tunnel is beginning to shine, the possibility of normal life is gradually coming back to our hands, and all this will be over before you know it.

We may have passed 1,000,000 cases in the US, but if we do things right, we may not see the 2,000,000th.

Ultimately, what all of these statistics mean is that whilst April may sound like Wake Me Up When September Ends, everything is lining up for May to instead sound like Through The Fire and The Flames...

Right now in my area we can have nightclubs operating at full capacity but we can't have in person mental health care.

"2021-01-26",1611621179,"Pandemic cost me my relationship","Made a post about this a few months ago on another sub but I figured this would be a better place to talk about it (and the situation has changed since then as well).

Long story short, I haven't been able to see my girlfriend of two years since March last year when the pandemic went into full swing because I live with my parents who are at very high risk. I tried to come up with some sort of compromise with them, like maybe I could see her downstairs in the basement once every couple months and then quarantine after for example, but absolutely nothing I have said to them has gotten them to change their mind about letting me see her in *any* capacity outside of an odd couple socially distanced visits (which honestly upset me more than anything). Obviously I don't want to risk their health or get them sick, but their complete and utter lack of a will to compromise is cruel to me whether they realize it or not.

This time apart was taking quite the toll on my girlfriend, who has been able to work and see friends on the regular (whether or not that's the most responsible thing to do is another story); she has much younger, much less at-risk parents than me and thus her risk assessment is going to be much different from mine. In the beginning of December she told me she needed a break from the relationship because the mental toll of living life without me while I'm stuck at home was too much for her. After about a month of that I told her that this break was absolute torture and waiting for her to make a decision was eating me alive. She felt like she had no choice but to break up with me. The way we left it, it seemed she was open to talking again in the future, and possibly trying again, but until my parents at the very least get vaccinated it looks like I'm going to be on my own.

I can't help but feel bitter towards this situation. None of this would be happening if COVID never happened. The pandemic genuinely destroyed my relationship with a girl who I legitimately saw myself marrying some day. The past few weeks have been extremely difficult for me to get through and I don't know how I'm going to manage getting through the next couple months until I (or at least my parents) get the vaccine. Everything just sucks right now and I just need to know if I'm crazy for still wanting to be with her once this is over.","COVID19_support",5,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/l51vae/pandemic_cost_me_my_relationship/"
"2021-10-07",1633640991,"Seeking solidarity from other lonely, isolated &amp; anxious people","Since the pandemic started, I've been really scared of catching COVID. At first, we were all in it together - I stayed inside my house 24/7 for the lockdowns but so did a lot of people.

But now, it's two years later. Everything is 'back to normal' - except I can't move on. I'm still terrified of the virus (side note: I have OCD and health anxiety).

I do have some reasons to be cautious; I'm only 25 but I'm a type 1 diabetic. Nonetheless, I live my life like I'm 70 years old with multiple health conditions. I work from home, live alone, and most days I don't see anyone at all. I just sit alone in the house all day, except for when I go out to exercise or get takeaway food.

What's more, despite my low social contact, I constantly feel paranoid that I'm experiencing COVID symptoms - sore throat, cough, itchy nose. Sometimes I get myself into a state of panic, doing multiple COVID tests and checking my temperature over and over again.

All my friends are living their lives like normal and I've lost count of the invitations I've turned down. I've bought tickets to so many fun events, thinking I'd be ready, and then bailed. When I see everyone else getting on with it, I feel like such a pathetic weirdo.

I can't blame them for living their lives, and I know they are the rational ones. I'm throwing away the best years of my life just because of fear. I probably wouldn't even get that sick from COVID. But I still can't get over it.

Some days I feel so unbearably lonely. It feels like I'm the only one still living in this horrendous cycle of anxiety. But I know that can't be true. Hope to speak to some other people who are struggling and maybe we can help each other feel less alone.

"2020-04-03",1585899502,"NEW YORK CITY to NEW YORK SHITTY ...but the lights still shine bright.","Since many of us are home quarantining with milk and cookies while binge watching *Netflix*, I thought Id open up a window into my world as a New Yorker during these COVID days. I find myself here on Reddit with a fire in my belly to share and internalize my experiences. **In the process I hope I can crack a smile on your face.**

If you didnt know, New York City has a mostly aggressive and no nonsense approach to the everyday experience. We are ASSHOLES..(at least it looks like it) for good reasons. We want our food fast. We HATE looking for parking. We want to own apartments and choose to live on pennies to have a decent place. We want to spend less money. We want work to end quickly without having to endure a painful rush hour via public transportation. Or is that just me? Amid all the hectic obstacles that are sometimes unavoidable, **we want joy.** Joy in business, love, friendship, spirituality, family, freedom. Ive found that it can get lost in distractions that the city presents. This is not the New York City I currently live in. **Theres a new asshole in town.** His name is COVID-19, and he is dictating our lives. Maybe not everyones. Since his arrival, paranoia and real change has been present. Life feels like a movie -a sort of sci-fi drama with twists and turns. For some, its a joke and another way to capitalize on being funny on an Instagram feed. Others completely disregard science or make ignorant statements like tobacco kills people, but people are worried about COVID. Heres a shout-out to the bonehead for not pointing out that COVID-19 can take your life within days/weeks. Im positive but realistic. Sorry people, Im with science on this one. Dont get me started on the almighty saving us. God may take care of us.. **in the ER**, and now I sound like an asshole.

4 weeks ago, I began to repair a relationship. We were easing back into a promising one, but the timing wasn't exactly convenient. COVID-19 was present in New York and New Jersey, but the spread wasnt as significant as it is now. (I feel like Rick from *The Walking Dead* narrating the outbreaks beginnings). She had concerns about a case in Westchester, Bronx, only a few miles away from where I live. She was heading to Miami, Florida for a personal vacation. I told her not to worry, and I agreed to take care of her 10 percent headache / 90 percent sweet and perfect couch potato of a puppy at my place. We enjoyed one last lunch date before her departure. It was memorable because of the genuine nature of enjoying our time together, but it was also a notable moment of fear and preparation for the unknown becoming real. I vividly remember doing some grocery shopping with her and seeing hordes of masked customers stacking their carts with water, chicken, and tissue (the outbreak essentials!). Our day ended with a sweet kiss and a 30 min Uber ride to the Bronx with initial puppy cries back home.

A few days later, I received a notice on my door about someone possibly being infected in my buildings management office less than half a mile away. **SHIT.** Back to my boo..

While in Miami, she texted me every day with some sort of update on how her day was. On one particular night, she didnt respond. I intuitively felt something was wrong and followed it up with a call. No answer. The next day, I found out she was in the emergency room. SHIT. (It was a knee and hernia issue that required surgery). The hospital eventually released her early due to the rising demand of patients with **REAL emergencies.** She flew back home on her own while being assisted on a wheelchair. **Talk about a SHIT end of a vacation.**

I spent a few more days with my step daughter pup while she was home recovering. This was a time of rapid thoughts, questions, and furry bonding. Dog walks were spent with surgical gloves and occasional masks. Workouts were taken outdoors, a perfect way to also compliment dog playing time. I began to receive a lot of phone texts / COVID-19 updates about the urgency to stay home. The NEWS presented important to misleading information, and so I began to focus on getting FACTS from respectable scientists. When I wanted to take a BREAK from the news and escape in the world of sports, repeat playoff games reminded me of the impact of this virus. Businesses were preparing to shut down, and I hated not being able to sit down at my local coffee spot or bar that allowed dogs. Where do I go from here? Im not part of the demographic, I told myself. Im fit!... or am I? Im a type 1 diabetic. **Am I considered HIGH RISK?** Ugh. Should I go to work? Should I take public transportation to work? My train rides arent packed, and my 6am Monday morning commute is now quiet and peaceful, but homeless people are swarming them as temporary shelters. FUCK. I guess this is all an illusion. As for the pup, I wondered if I should be concerned about her licking me like a damn ice cream? Could I infect her? When I see my boo again, should I not kiss her? When will we have sex again! Can I bend the rules for social distancing? UGH. **Everything is in slow motion these days.**

When I returned my step daughter pup, **SHE** asked if Id be offended if she sprayed me down with Lysol disinfectant. I warmly laughed and told her I understood. In fact, I wasnt sure if she was comfortable with me staying. I didnt know if I should lay down next to her, especially since she was already recovering from her operation and experiencing pain from another condition due to a past pregnancy. If I had this virus, would I be endangering her? Her dad was also there, and I wondered how me possibly being infected could endanger him. She wanted me there, and I wanted to be there, but I would have easily left. I probably should have. It was all so confusing to try to make the best decision. The next few hours felt like earlier times as we Netflixed and quaran-chilled. I even baked her some surgical masked cupcakes with a box that read Will you be my Quarentine? (A play on Valentine). A few hours later she felt a pain in her stomach and needed to head to the emergency room. I JINXED IT. SHIT.

I havent been to an emergency room in years. I helped her inside, and even though my priority was to get her in quickly and tended to, I couldnt help notice a containment area outside by the ER entrance. As we entered, the air felt thick, or maybe that was my paranoia talking. The nurses probably mistook me for a patient, and so that likely bought me extra time inside. **Five minutes inside that area was a lifetime of fear.** My boo trembled and cried, and then she reached her hand out to firmly grab mine. It was the first time I experienced this flush of emotion to want to protect her, where nothing mattered, The NBA didnt matter. Netflix didnt matter. Going to work didnt matter. I saw an overweight man on a respirator being pushed on a stretcher right by me, and all I could think about was whether he had the infection. Im sure she thought the same. EVERYTHING was in slow motion. She reached out her hand again, and I told her everything would be okay. The nurse then requested that I wait outside.  **Everything is infected,** she said. Those very words ping ponged around in my head as I proceeded to the exit in a trance-like state.

For the next few hours, I patiently waited for the outcome at the ER. I sat on the one lone chair outside the entrance in protective gear messaging / receiving messages from my boo while drinking coffee to prepare for what would end up being a 5 hour process of broken sleep and seeing different walks of life drop in. I looked like Kenny from *South Park* with my eyes peeking through a hoodie tightly secured around my face. I appreciate you bringing me, she told me. **Those words alone made me feel a sense of value in her life**, and I was happy to be by her side. I wish I could have physically been inside, but I tried my best to send her some good juju / energy. I needed some myself while hearing intense radio chatter echo from within the hospitals walls.The next few hours gave me time to internalize the reality of real fear, love, and what the future held. I thought about my newborn nephew and wondered when was the next time I was going to hold him. I wondered when Id be able to be in the physical presence of my grandmother that I never built a strong relationship with. I thought about my brother who is asthmatic. When will I have a reunion with friends to kick the shit. My parents are relatively healthy, but are they truly safe? Despite these rational fears, I was happy to be in a space that made me seek important answers and find real purpose. My heart guided my actions. I can afford to call out of work tonight, I told myself. I want to be here. \*\*This is genuine love..\*\*Love for my family.. Love for my boo.. Love for my friends and everyone that have had an impact in my life.

I decided to go back to her place and pick her up after her results. As the night progressed, her mood was more upbeat, but her observations were telling of the world we live in, especially for nurses and doctors putting their lives on the line for us. With limited supplies available, they still provided her with extra treatment. They cautioned her against bringing shoes inside her apartment. They revealed alarming information about deaths from the night before and the high risk exposure from doctors and nurses themselves that lived in New York City. **Has she been exposed? Have I?** SHIT. SHIT. SHIT.

After a couple of hours at my boos place zoned in on CNN updates, she was released from the hospital. I immediately Ubered my way back to her. Her spirits were higher and she was mostly pain free. She was cleared of COVID-19 systems in the process. She expressed gratitude for my presence, and I reminded her that she was a priority. **She is a priority**.. but *where do we go from here?*

I dont know whens the next time ill be cuddling with my boo again or when we will have a worry free night and can dance the night away. I know relationships can be complicated, but COVID-19 threw me a curveball. **Physical touch is therapeutic**, and there lies the dilemma. I hate that I cant touch her. Maybe I can, but I shouldnt. I won't ask for it. Is COVID-19 affecting relationships for everyone else? Is it making it worse? Stronger? I believe this separation from the people I love made me realize what Ive taken for granted or never properly expressed. **Im not religious, but this feels like a test.** I hope Im passing.

Theres still so much I dont know, but these days Im trying to be vigilant about my health and how I affect others. Thats not always easy. **Humans are bound to fuck up.** Im trying my best to embrace the challenge and this new dynamic. The escalating death toll is real. The infected are real. The confusion is real. LOVE is real, and that doesnt have to die with COVID-19. I see light at the end of this dark tunnel. **Theres still beauty behind the madness.**","COVID19_support",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fu4233/new_york_city_to_new_york_shitty_but_the_lights/"
"2020-04-16",1587025775,"Scared my husband is getting sick","My husband delivers food to people's houses for his job. He's being very cautious and staying far away from all his customers, but he still has to go into public buildings most days to use bathrooms (he does wear a mask, but only a cotton one). And almost no one else who works for his company is taking things seriously - they're not social distancing (despite company rules). He sees those co-workers twice a week, plus alternates trucks with them. There's so many potential ways he could get infected.

Lately he's had a minor cough, and today he has a minor sore throat and feels achy in some areas. He's 29 and generally healthy, but when he gets sick, he usually gets quite a bit sicker than me. He's also a former smoker (switched to vaping 2 years ago, then quit vaping 6 months ago). And, he drank quite a bit over the weekend, then a medium amount on Monday and Tuesday. It makes me extra nervous since binge drinking lowers your immunity. 

(TRIGGER WARNING for this paragraph only - scary descriptions of cases) I've read so many stories of people being horribly sick for weeks and weeks at a time. Some people even just die suddenly at home apparently. And, the virus can affect your heart...last time he went to a doctor his heart seemed fine, but there are tons of severe heart issues that run in both sides of his family. His grandpa actually died of the virus last week...

I'm so terrified. He's my entire world and I would lose my mind if anything happened to him. I have severe anxiety about him dying suddenly already. It often makes me act irrationally. I don't know how I'd manage if he got sick. I'm also scared of course of getting the virus myself, and that my crazy anxiety for him would lower my immune system. I'm still overweight from my recent pregnancy too, which can apparently make things worse...

Speaking of pregnancy, to top it all off, we have a 6 month old - I'm scared of us getting so sick we can't take care of him (scared of him getting sick too of course, but not as much since babies seem to be mostly spared, miraculously)

Ugh. I've been nervous about this virus ever since Wuhan shut down, and have been obsessively wiping down our groceries, avoiding public places (we do grocery pickup), having us both take vitamins that help immunity, etc since mid February. I can usually keep my fear under control, but now the possibility of him being sick is making it all boil over again

It was kind of a running joke in the office about how i was the guinea pig and they'd consider picking up international travel again if I made it back in one piece.

I (27F) am a music teacher. Due to a variety of circumstances, I have yet to be at a school longer than a year which has been really tough. My first job (PreK-8th) was part-time and I was was barely making rent. My second job (5th-8th) was nice but it was a long-term sub position. At my third job (PreK-5th), I was absolutely miserable every single day and decided that teaching elementary music was not for me. I resigned that position and last summer I finally found a job teaching high school. I finally felt like I found a school where I belonged and I had room to grow for several years.

About two months ago my school informed me that they would not be renewing my contract. The circumstances are really sketchy and I spent weeks trying to advocate for myself and seek legal advice but ultimately, even though the school's behavior is shitty, it is not illegal as teachers in the first 3 years of service in the district have basically no rights. This has been an absolutely devastating blow. It really feels like a bad breakup. I am so upset and frustrated that I need to find a new job for the fifth year in a row in the middle of a global pandemic and massive economic crisis.

I can't decide if I should pursue teaching in the fall or not. On one hand, I feel like I keep getting knocked down by this profession and a little break might be a good idea. I love teaching music but all of these shitty situations have been really hard and discouraging. I am also EXTREMELY concerned about the safety of returning to school in the fall. My state (MA) has released some guidelines for reopening schools and they are absolutely ridiculous - basically schools need to obtain their own PPE, everyone needs to stay 6 ft apart, classes can't be more than 10 people, etc. This is tough for your average homeroom teacher but even tougher for a music teacher like me - I often see 200+ students in a given day. Will I get sick? Will I be hired somewhere just to have my position cut three weeks later? Will I only be able to go from home to work and back and not be able to see any of my family because I'm not ""quarantined""?

On the other hand, I don't know what kind of job I could get that would be any safer. Waiting tables of unmasked people seems extremely dangerous. Leaning on my parents for support is not an option so I need to find something where I can pay rent and be able to support myself.

Which brings me to the next issue: I have no choice but to move out of my apartment due to major landlord/roommate issues - my landlord has done some really sketchy stuff that would be illegal in other states. My roommate is extremely unsafe and my landlord doesn't take my complaints seriously. So now I need to find an apartment as well. I am wanting to find a nice place that will allow my pet but I am worried that by the time I find a job, I will have to rush to get an apartment and may end up in another bad situation. Part of me doesn't want to wait until I have a job to look for apartments but I won't know what I can afford if I do that.

I am so overwhelmed by all of this that I can't bring myself to make any progress. I am hoping to talk to a career center to help make my resume and cover letter look better but I am having trouble finding places that aren't coaching services, which I am not interested in.

I feel like I'm in over my head. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks for reading.","COVID19_support",9,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hk72cv/need_to_find_a_new_job_and_apartment_so/"

"2020-07-11",1594500570,"Had COVID at home months ago, been lowkey traumatized and paranoid since then","Hi! My family had COVID during the beginning of May, my father being the only family member confirmed as positive (we didn't check the rest because we didn't have major symptoms and we didn't want to risk it - we live in Chile). Fortunately it was nothing more than a big scare, as my father never developed any kind of symptoms beyond a mild cough and diziness sometimes.

But it was such a stressful time (two members of my family I love very much have risks factors) that I don't know if I have recovered yet. Nothing I ever lived came close to the stress we felt. I have a history with depression (having had a major episode in 2016) and panic attacks. I haven't had panic attacks this year which I consider a major accomplishment but I fear a lot having depression again. Now, I haven't been in a specially bad mood lately, but I've been hella stressed from work (I'm a teacher).

I feel like I have worked so hard to get where I want to be in my mental health, and I have so much fear about going back to that dark place I was able to get out from with a lot of effort, yet I find it hard to sleep. I still sleep 8 hours but on an unnatural schedule and I don't rest enough. I'm tired all the time and sometimes it gets addictive to just lie in my bed and stare at the ceiling, rather than doing anything productive or fun.

Before the virus got into my house 2 months ago, I was doing fine with this whole pandemic thing. I was responsible yet I was calm. Now that we had the virus I am so afraid of getting the virus, not knowing if I had it. I had a cough and a stuffy nose for weeks when my dad got diagnosed. As soon as I find it convenient I'll check myself with a doctor, but right now hospitals are crazy in my country. If I had it I never had problems. But I still monitor myself everyday, checking if I can breath properly because I've had my nose stuffed for months and can't breath as well as I used to, which is very logical since my nose is full and it's winter, but it feeds into my hypochondria.

Worst part is I know this is such a petty issue I feel. Like I know I probably had the virus and since I'm 26 I should feel a little bit more statistically safe than I do, but I can't help being afraid, I can't help being sad sometimes. I don't feel I'm depressed because I feel like my sadness is very logical, the world is changing and it affects me, but I know a lot of sadness can develop into something pathological. When we got over this COVID thing I felt so grateful that everyone turned out ok, yet after we got out my godfather got it too and he got a little bit worse than us (still got out of it safely) and it was such an emotional blow. More people I know get affected and it's so sad :(

N95's, hand sanitizer, entering the arena as close to show time and leaving early, etc. The show has a mask requirement and only has a couple thousand attendees.

According to the news, my 5'6ish 273 pound self is pretty much a goner if I get COVID. Despite finally making the effort (starting right before COVID spread to America), using the stationary bike for 12 miles each day (4 times/week) and losing 23 pounds so far, along with having no major underlying conditions as per my doctor's visit a week ago, guess I started too late. My doctor did not seem worried about me when asking about my risk in COVID complications, but considering my 129/89 blood pressure at that same visit, I keep having doubts and am preparing that if I catch COVID, this could be the end for me.

I'm doing all I can to avoid it (only going out for groceries or walks, and luckily having to work from home), but if I catch it, I'll likely become a statistic as a 27 year old guy. I get that fat is unhealthy (especially at my size), I get it increases chances of complications for many diseases in general, but reddit and my news feed in general is getting filled with all these 'obesity=COVID death' type articles and discussions more and more, it's hard to shake out of my head and is effectively stamping out what's left of the 'We Can Do It' mindset that I had when we initially got into this mess. I accepted my fate, drafted my final statement in case I end up in ICU, but I'll still keep on my diet/exercise regime in the meantime in hopes for the best, even if my time feels limited now. Thanks for reading.

EDIT: Thanks for knocking some sense back into me, I guess I've overblown my fears a tad bit. Onwards and upwards with my diet/exercise, and less time reading the news and r/coronavirus.

"2021-03-20",1616248437,"Between Being Too Careful vs Living Normally: Am I a loser for being serious about COVID safety and missing out on going out and meeting others?","I totally understand that COVID safety is a hot hot hot topic so please refrain from being black and white about it, because Im not attacking anybody nor am I calling anybody wrong. Im just asking for your perspectives, not your end-all answer. 

For months, even before vaccines started to be administered, Ive seen so many friends and people in general meeting up and going out and what not (most of the time Ive seen them masked). All the while I, living with a very stubborn 2 and a half year old and working an involving job that I can work remotely, have been very diligent by staying home and only going outside for walks by ourselves with masks and not even going to playgrounds or meeting other kids outdoors. 

Now that the vaccines are out and things will only get better from here, the activity of others has picked up dramatically and yet Im still wanting to be diligent in staying home and not going to playgrounds or meeting others outdoors. But Im getting extreme FOMO in missing out on taking what Ive sacrificed for the last year, and anxiety that Im depriving my 2 year old on very important social interaction.

On the topic of my 2 year old missing social interaction, I was okay with that for the first year, but now shes pretty much 2 and a half years old, shes getting far more advanced comprehensively and confidently able to run around without tripping too much, so at this point she should get more stimulation than a puzzle or toy. 

As for my FOMO, Ive worked so hard to overcome feeling like a loser for the last 15 years (Im 35) because Im so socially awkward sometimes. Before this pandemic I was pretty good at making small talk and listening to others and so forth because Ive worked on forcing myself to do so, where as my introverted self would just sulk and not talk to anybody. But now, Im afraid Im losing that and Im feeling like because Im being social distant and, thereby, awkward (friends want to hang out but now I gotta say sorry, social distancing, yo), then when Im finally ready to meet friends Ill be the loser that skipped out on the social interactions and inside jokes that my friends will have. 

In other words, if the question asked is hey, hows it going?. Ill say oh, nothing. I stayed home and social distanced. Nothing has happened. My friends will say oh Ive meet up with this, Ive done that, weve done this, weve met up with XYZ and so forth. And then Ill feel horrible knowing that throughout all this time it was perfectly safe to do almost anything as long as you have masks. 

Also, because of my busy job and the very busy task of taking care of a 2 and a half year old, Ive been basically working 60-70 hours a week ever since last march. I dont even have time for a casual Zoom call. So life for me has been work, work, work, work, work, work, work 7am-11pm. Then when I have time to take a breather (which is 1 hour before I pass out asleep), I just spend it watching a few Youtube videos. At first I was very ambitious to work hard and willing to take the impact of working long days because I knew that the fact that I still had a job, and that work has picked up (I work in an infrastructure related job so demand actually increased as most governments increase these activities in order to generate jobs and future demand once the crisis is over), I knew that proving myself and doing well solidifies myself in keeping my job or I get to move up my career faster, but now that the crisis is pretty much ending, I feel there isnt going to be any compensation for the hard work any time soon or at all (companies over the months have basically clenched harder on raises or promotions), so Im feeling less motivated. So now Im feeling that Im working extra hard in every aspect for no reason. And if things are truly safer at this point, am I wasting my time not putting my 2 and a half year old in daycare and at least giving myself relief and doing my job in 40 hours rather than 60-70 hours?

There's not much that I can do with the 25 lbs dumbbells I have that would have any significant benefit on my performance. I don't like exercising, I like training for strongman. Even more than that, it just feels futile to try to find a way to work on it at all even if I could. That hobby is one where any individual instance of participating in it isn't anything special, the fun part is the knowledge that each session, each set, each repetition is building to something greater than the sum of its parts at some point in the future. And when I think about that now, even if I had all the equipment I wanted, all I can think is ""what's the point?"" It just feels like there's no point in doing anything whose benefit is theoretical and far in the future, so I can't find any joy in thinking about the thing that used to make me more passionate than anything in the world. On top of that, the smaller hobbies that I have that aren't illegal like playing music and cooking just don't bring me joy. Thinking about sitting at my keyboard or planning a meal just feels like an insurmountable effort and any time I've tried, they bring me no joy at all.

Where I live, we're under ridiculously strict restrictions. Gyms are obviously closed, as is any business considered ""non-essential,"" businesses lucky enough to be ""essential"" can't sell ""non-essential"" items, we're not allowed to socialize with anyone from outside our homes under threat of a fine of several thousand dollars. Despite most of these restrictions having been in place for months, and the rest, for weeks, cases continue to rise and we set new records every week. On top of that, my country is vaccinating at a snail's pace, so since the measures are proving ineffective and seeing the effects of vaccines feels like it'll be a very long time away, these restrictions are likely to stay in place that long and probably get more severe. Everything we do feels so pointless and I can't look forward to anything.

Is anyone else dealing with this? I feel like the common suggestion is to find solace in your hobbies, but I can't do that.

In November of 2019, I left my severely abusive partner (who I lived with in another country) and moved 5,000 miles back home to my parents. A few months later... covid happened. 

I ended up with debilitating PTSD from the abuse (which I've been working on in therapy and making progress!) but I think that might have affected how I reacted to the pandemic. 

I locked down *hard*. Granted I was also living with my nearly 70 year old parents and wanted to protect them as well. But before vaccines, we didn't grocery shop or go anywhere. Literally didn't leave the house. Worked remotely. 

Post-vaccine, I began going to stores, seeing a few select friends in their homes every once in a while, occasionally dining outdoors (like 3 times total lol)... and that's about it. Oh, I also moved out and now I live alone.

I keep waiting for things to get a bit better, start taking a few more risks, and then they just get worse and I isolate again.

I left my partner and moved home when I was 27. I'm 30 now and I feel like literal years of my life are just gone. 

I try to talk about it with my therapist, but I can't really take her advice seriously because she never cared much about covid. Her advice is pretty much just ""oh yeah, it's 100% your anxiety and you need to overcome that and just live normally"" which... yeah, definitely a lot of it is health anxiety, but there still is a pandemic. 


So I just feel so trapped.

Something I REALLY want to do is try dating again. It took so much effort to leave my abusive partner, do the work to recover from that trauma, and feel ready to date again. But how can I?

Edit- Added:. Also, I wonder if people are still getting long covid from the new Omicron variants?

"2021-03-23",1616460000,"Feeling unlikely things will ever be the same","26M, healthcare worker, PNW, have worked directly with COVID patients through much of the pandemic. I have seen first hand the devastation COVID can cause and I am not minimizing it at all. I am pro mask and vaxx and all of that.... But for me, the cure was worse than the disease as far as restrictions and isolation go. Asking you to please not eat me alive for this post because trust me, I understand its unhealthy.....

First, I feel extremely lucky to have had a job through this. I feel very thankful to not have lost any family members in 2020. I feel like I escaped 2020 roughly unscathed, and I feel selfish in saying- it was actually a pretty good year for me in terms of accomplishing things and meeting goals...... to further preface, I went into all of this with a pretty severe mental illness that is (has been?) previously well controlled, and heavily impacts my viewpoint on how this went down.

I also managed to miraculously not contract COVID, and am now dually vaccinated. And I am having the worst time I've had since all of this started. Was it the isolation that got me? Was I impacted more by the suffering around me than I thought? I don't know how to describe it, but I am so angry. I was never particularly anxious about getting COVID (figured I would and it would be what it would be), but I was over the top careful to avoid getting the rona for fear of thereby passing it on to someone vulnerable. I feel like no one else was and everyone else got COVID anyway and now they are fine, while I seem to have completely backslid on all the progress I made from a mental health standpoint and am literally struggling everyday to even find the will to want to live. I'm literally in crisis and because of restrictions I wasn't around anyone who would've noticed until it was too late. Now despite treatment and medication and therapy I am barely even back to the worst of previous episodes.

The people who I truly care most about not getting COVID (high risk relatives) have not been eligible yet to be vaccinated. Meanwhile I am walking around with 95% immunity. I got the vaccine to protect them, but didn't understand the real possibility I could pass it on anyway. I have a ridiculous fear that all the ones I know who got COVID will develop some long term condition, and that watching them suffer will be far worse than being among them. I have survivors guilt for every patient I care for who isn't vaccinated and is dying of COVID. In some bizarre way (please please don't yell at me, trust me I understand that this is tone deaf to the many people who've had loved ones die), I wish I wouldve ran headfirst towards COVID at the start. Then I would've known I was safe and not isolated as much. I feel like the isolation permanently fucked me up and I literally don't feel like I can recover.

Everyone who wasn't so careful and got it but lucked out with mild to moderate cases just chat about their quarantine and symptoms and new found immunity and I can barely get out of bed. I am failing school, failing life, have lost one of my jobs for absenteeism (despite being the only one to never get COVID/need two weeks off during nov/dec and working unreasonable OT to cover them), have lost countless friends, and jump between extreme paranoia and crushing hopelessness. The world around me seems to be bursting with life and hope for the first time in a year, and I've never felt worse. I wish almost desperately I could have a do over and have not gotten to this non-recoverable point. I thought COVID was the enemy, and all along my own mind was the real risk (for my low risk self).

&amp;#x200B;

ETA: I understand many people who were careful got it, lost loved ones, etc. I am truly sorry for your loss and not intending to lump you in with the people I am talking about. I understand many couldn't work from home, I was among you. This is strictly to say that I didn't understand how my own decision to be very careful so negatively impacted my mental health, and as much as I wish I could change it- I seem to have backslid through years of progress and stability. I know it doesn't seem significant compared to the loss of life over 2020- but it feels significant when voices in my head are literally demanding I end this.

For some background I have asthma, I have been awaiting a rheumatologist appointment because my bloodwork with my pcp showed positive signs for auto immune.  and On Monday September 19th I was exposed by someone who was positive. I didn't start to feel symptoms until the 22nd and didn't test positive until the 25rd. In the beginning the symptoms were mild. Small cough, lil runny nose. by the 28th I realized the medicine I take for the unspecified auto immune pain stopped working and my joints felt terrible. Then I tried my darnest to take all medication to help with symptoms. Take hot baths almost 3 times a day give or take. And The night of Oct 2nd was terrible. I could not sleep, I was coughing non stop my throat was so swollen, So much mucus backup in my head, my chest felt tight, coughing so much made my breathe feel short. All I could think about is going to an Er or immediate care. It didn't feel like life or death so I'm like immediate care, That makes sense right? So I waited for one to open at 7am in the morning. Probably what you'd expect, Immediate care told me they could not help me, go to ER. I didn't that day because by the time i was sitting in the office at 8am, I felt better. so I managed. I went home took more medicine went to sleep in the middle of the day then carried on.

So when actual night time came around I went to sleep sorta okay, took me a lil while but i did eventually. Then I woke up, had to pee no biggy, went to the bathroom looking in the mirror with my goo filled eyes and i didnt feel as bad as the night before so.  Immediately as I turned around to sit on the toilet, everything got blurry, I felt so nauseous and dizzy. I kept saying after  all this that it genuinely felt like i was gonna shit, puke, and pass out. Its almost as if all of a sudden to I got hot and sweaty like my body was on fire. I don't know how else to describe it, I tried to stand but felt too woozy and sat on the bathroom floor till the thoughts of ""I need to wake my partner, this isnt okay"" so I stumbled but made it to my bedroom and woke my partner who i forever am grateful, took me to the ER. Its 4am on a Monday morning, we were one of the very few there. Everyone was very super nice. I forgot to mention, my heart rate at immediate care was 150 and then 138 on the ekg. When first admitted to the ER it was the same, so they immediately did the ekg aswell. From 4am-10am My heart rate stayed consistently from 100-115. 120-130 if I stood up or went pee.  I never regularly monitored my heart rate to know if this is normal, my only frame of reference is one time my heart rate was 140 and i felt that POUND, it didn't even feel like my hear was going that fast this whole time. I mention this in maybe other's experience it too I don't know.

So they did a chest x ray and did a CT scan, never had one before that shit was scary my god. I ended up being okay obviously but woof. Anyways, after a oxygen monitored walk- that was cut short due to my heart going up to 140 that was the last test they did. Mind you throughout all of this my oxygen was consistently 94-99 this whole time. So when 9:30 ish rolls around the doctor comes in and says you dont have blood clots but you came out positive for covid pneumonia. The positive side of that is my oxygen levels are really good so we don't think you need to be hospitalized but if your oxygen does drop then come back to the er. They kept me longer to finish giving me fluids because turns out I was also really dehydrated. Thankfully not blood clots, thankfully its not the serious type where I need to be put on a breathing machine(knock on wood). The unknown is still scary though. And I feel alone in this honestly because the person who gave it to me went on a trip to a music festival with 2 of our mutual friends whom also got it and they all turned out fine.

"2020-09-04",1599263822,"Struggling with my husbands COVID anxiety","This post is mostly to vent but also to seek support during a trying time. 

My (35F) husband (38M) is a germaphobe and has hated hospitals his entire life. Back in March, we had our first serious talk about COVID and he basically said that if he catches it, he does not want to go to a hospital for treatment, no matter how bad it gets. He essentially said he wants to just die at home if he catches COVID and gets very sick. He also said he wouldnt visit me if I went into the hospital. 

That was hard to handle/react to. 

He is also stressed due to a less than-ideal work-life balance right now in his contract position as a software engineer. Hes recently become the breadwinner for his father and step-mother, whose income has been drastically reduced due to COVID restrictions in my father-in-laws line of work. He had a breakdown from burnout and financial stress back in April and I literally thought our marriage was ending. 

At the worst of it, he told me he didnt have the energy to deal with me (I had been having near daily breakdowns) and that he just needed me to not be anywhere near him for a while so he could get his head on straight. 

He and I have yet to really talk about what all happened, excluding some superficial talk of how he can avoid burnout again on this new contract he started two weeks ago. 

Which brings me to todays issue, that has my whole being caught up in a whirl. My grandmother (86) has been at an assisted living facility for years now and theyve done an excellent job keeping COVID out of the facility. Grammy really wanted a haircut, though, so she asked me to take her to a salon so she could get it cut. 

I wasnt terribly comfortable with the idea of her going to a salon, and my husband was pretty angry about the very idea of it. Before I went to pick her up this morning, he told me to tell her,  I really dont appreciate her endangering my wife.

And then I got home from taking her to the salon. She was the only client there the entire time, and I stayed in the car while she was seen. I showered immediately upon getting home but noticed my husband was a little more withdrawn in his home office than usual. 

I always make us lunch. Lately, hes been really good about coming out of the home office during his lunch break so he gets a good solid break in his workday. 

Today, when I sort of caught him in the hallway after visiting the restroom, I asked if he had any requests: No, Ill get something myself. And went back into his office, closing the door behind him. 

Cue my heart falling. Tried to brush it off, to not take it personally, maybe he had a rough morning and just needs some space to decompress. 

5 pm, his usual Im done for the day, let me spend some time chilling on the couch with my wife before she starts making dinner time comes and goes. 6 pm, I knock on his office door. 

Dont come in here, stay in the doorway. I dont want you to make me anything. I dont want you near me for the next three days. You can thank your selfish grandmother for possibly exposing us.

Cue my heart breaking. These next three days are going to be hard. I texted him, basically begging him to not ignore me while I keep my distance. And his response didnt even have an I love you. 

Sorry this is so long, I just really needed to get this out. It hurts my heart so much but I know hes just reacting from anxiety about COVID. Its hard to not take it personally. I hope no one reading is going through anything like this. It sucks.

Edited on Day 2 to add:
He is extreme social distancing from me while in the same house due to my possible exposure to COVID despite everyone wearing masks (and the high likelihood my grandmother didnt pick it up in the salon somehow anyways...). We thankfully(?) have a full guest suite next to his home office, so hes been able to sequester himself. We have exchanged I love yous multiple times and hes even checked some things off our Before Trying To Conceive checklist, namely, doing research on cribs and strollers, so Im on a rollercoaster of emotions, folks. 

He and I are definitely going to have to talk seriously about all of this come Tuesday. I am still waiting to hear from a friend whos a Physicians Assistant about her recommendations for therapists, but Ive looked up Marriage and Family Therapists near us who accept our insurance. My next step is to research which ones are offering virtual visits so I have a list of options for him to choose from.

But it got me down. First, it's a reminder that I need to be more careful. I think I got it from a lady who was coughing near by when I was eating out. So that's a nope, now. 

Secondly, the only places I go are work, gym, grocery, home. I'm so bored and tired of seeing the same places. When I get bored, I tend to feel sad after some time. 

I've been trying to be creative (write, paint) and do other things that help me. Plus I learned techniques in therapy that help me with depression and anxiety tendencies. But... It's just rough to remind myself to do so, lately. 

Also, my job is very repetitive and unfulfilling. I recruit for low paying jobs that I wouldn't want, either, and for every 10 people I find, it seems we lose 10. So every day is the same and feels like I accomplish nothing and help no one. But I need the job because of its benefits - I'm due for dental surgery - and it IS an easy job, truly, I have no right to complain. 

I just don't know how to feel better. And I'm concerned that everything opening up soon will just bring COVID crashing down again. I'm in Florida and everyone seems to be catching omicron, even those of us who are careful.

In normal circumstances we wouldve relocated over the summer, but cases were high in Massachusetts at the time, then they were high in Texas and we decided to hold off and see how things go. Everyone at my new company is working remotely so there is no rush to get there. They understand the situation and are fine with us not being there right away. In September we decided we will make the move over Christmas  and have everything set up  movers, apartment lease, utilities, etc. Given the current situation with COVID we are debating whether or not to delay our move. Our reasons to delay include decrease our risk of exposure while in transit, if we were to get in an accident (it is winter, afterall) and hospitals are full, and if we have any issues traveling through states (borders closed? Need COVID tests?). For the last one, it is hard to predict what restrictions will be like a month from now when cases are predicted to be even higher post-Thanksgiving. Our reasons to continue with the move over Christmas is weve already put money down on an apartment and would have to pay a fee if we break the lease and we were hoping to get a feel for the area over spring and buy a house during the summer. I work in a university, so Id like to start the next school year fresh in a new home and hopefully things are somewhat back to normal. Also, if we move over Christmas our journey will include stops to see close family along the way that we havent seen in over a year. My wife is very social and doesnt always take masks and social distancing as serious as Id like (as do most people here) and I think if we were in Massachusetts where we only know a couple people she wont have as much temptation to socialize and that risk would decrease.

I'm not losing out on a whole lot.

But the people are insane. In a normal situation, I'd look at the food in the house and say ""Oh, we can make it another two weeks."" But now I look and I just don't know if that was long enough. I'm not here for panic buying, but apparently the rest of the community is, because the stores around here are drained, and it's not getting better. The shelves are consistently empty.

How long is it supposed to stay like this? Are people going to stop buying eventually? Or is this it, now? Is it going to be empty shelves and panic stocking until they get a vaccine developed, best case scenario, some time next year?

To explain in more detail, my dad owns a restaurant in Germany, and I help him run it, and if hes on vacation visiting his Girlfriend in Canada like he is right now, I also do a bunch of management stuff. We also deliver beverage crates to several places, like the local butchers shop and a care home for disabled people.

Now to the fun part: On sunday a friend of mine stayed over night and I drove her to work the next day, later that day she told me she had fever and the next day she told me she was quarantined for 14 days since her mother also showed some of the symptons. So I thought I am going to do the sensible thing and quarantine myself for 14 days aswell. I phoned my dad and explained to him the situation and thought he got the message: Im potentially infected, and thus wont make any deliveries for the next 14 days. But today he sent me a message if I already did the deliveries, and after I didnt reply to such a stupid question he said that hes sad I dont talk more with him about the business and if I have a problem with him, and to be honest, I kinda do after stuff like this situation. I told him that I was quite mad about him seemingly ignoring my concerns for my own and other peoples health and safety, to which he replied, freely translated from german:

"" You got any symptons? Life goes on, just wear some gloves and dont talk to people (I have to ask people in the care center what exactly they need, any idea how to do that without talking to them?). Just do your job. And if you think that you are terminally ill then get some help, They need their drinks since they arent closed. I think you are overreacting and abusing the situation.""

Im terrified.","I work in a smoothie cafe to help pay my way through college, and I havent worked since the beginning of March. Ive got bills to pay that I cant put off anymore, so I picked up two shifts at the cafe. My family and I figured itd be okay for me to work there because the cafe has a strict mask policy and my manager is 7 months pregnant, so we all figured extra precautions were being taken.

When I first got there today, I was anxious because the store is pretty small, and the back area where we do food prep/office work is an enclosed space with no windows. But at first, my manager and 3 coworkers and I were all masked and as distanced as we could be, so it started out fine. My mask was even duct taped to my face along the top of my mask. 

But after an hour, my coworkers pretty much threw all precaution out the window. All 3 of them took their masks off and were all huddled talking and laughing in the back area. 

I tried to stay up front as much as I could, but during the lunch rush, I had to run into the back for more supplies. In doing so, I had to push right through the middle of the group of my unmasked coworkers because they wouldnt move out of the way and the area is so small that they wouldnt even have been able to move much.

I get that this was only a few seconds of potential exposure, but Im terrified. They were all unmasked, talking and laughing as I walked by, pretty much shoulder to shoulder with all of them. I know at least two of them have been out and about in public with no mask. I fear my mask couldnt protect me from all of that. 

Im quarantined with my 54 year old mom, and I want to keep her safe at all costs. Ive been panicking all day. Ive distanced myself from my mom since getting home, but we live in a small townhouse. 

What is the risk for this situation? For reference, Im in America where its pretty bad.

Saturday morning I'm about halfway through the four hour drive and she calls me to say her throat is kind of sore, she goes and gets a rapid test and the result is negative. I figure it's just a cold, I mean we're vaccinated after all. We spend the whole weekend together and her sore throat turns into a cough and full blown cold symptoms. She has two more tests through out the week (both rapid and pcr) and both come back negative.

So, about me: I'm 23, black, from a state in the upper South of the US. I attended a pretty competitive private liberal arts college in my state, graduated with honors in May 2019 with two majors, two minors, and a host of extracurriculars.

I had a good time during my undergrad years, for the most part. I got a full scholarship, so thankfully student loans aren't something I have to think about, at all. My school has a huge reputation for being run by preppy white kids in Greek life, and in some ways that's true. But personally, I found a good, solid, diverse friend group and never felt as if I were missing out on much. I was also involved in a lot of goings-on around the school, so I stayed busy.

But, you know, one thing I was never good at was relationships. I don't get them, at all. I've gone on dates, kissed girls, but never had a girlfriend or even really a hook-up. It just boggles my mind that someone seriously could find a person attractive enough to have sex with them \*that very night\*. And that there are guys who do this all the time. I guess I'm just super insecure about myself. I'm not ugly, I thinkI've had several people tell me I'm all right attractive just this weekendbut I just don't get it. I think a few girls were trying to get with me, but I was too dumb to really pick up what they were putting down. I honestly feel like such a beta for having never banged anyone, but consciously I know it's entirely arbitrary and that whole alpha-beta thing is just toxic crock. But the fact that I spent my whole college career and never did it bothers me and I feel like a loser, though I didn't feel so bad about it when I was actually in school. Only in retrospect. Sorry for the tangent, but I guess it's relevant.

I didn't really enjoy my last year of college, on account of I took up way too much on my plate. Spent most of the last couple months of the semester on the verge of collapse, honestly. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do exactly after graduation, so I moved back to my parent's home for a bit. By September I had secured a full-time contract job with a national news organization, which I probably shouldn't name here. It was entirely remote, which meant it would be a good idea for me to stay home and not waste my wages on rent somewhere for no reason. This was very isolating, as I really don't have any friends in my hometown, and I would have preferred to have a reason to move to New York so I could just live somewhere other than my hometown, but it was manageable. It was a pretty good gig. I have my name cited in a few letters from US senators now because of it.

During this time I applied for grad school. Starting tomorrow I am going to start working on a history MA, which is really cool. My new school is in Boston, but I'm doing the first semester remote to save even more money. I also got a full scholarship for this program.

Anyway, that job I had lasted from September to February, which brings us to COVID. Now, back in February, I was what many people would have called a COVID alarmist, by which I mean I would be bugging my family every night about how bad it was going to be and how we should prepare. Part of the reason I felt this way was because I had had to write stories about COVID in China and what a big problem it had been there. I knew it was only a matter of time before it hit us. So when my job ended in mid-February, I didn't bother looking for anything new, since I knew things would all shut down pretty soon. And I was right.

Well, you know how the next few months went. Death, anxiety, isolation, the whole nine yards. As a black person, my anxiety has been compounded by the fact that all the racists seem to have come out of the woodwork lately on Facebook to talk about killing us, plus there's news about us being executed in the streets by agents of the state, plus we are more likely to die from COVID. It's really not something I expect white people to getnot that that's necessarily their faultand I know this sub is bound to be mostly white. But, yeah. The fact that my ethnic group is dying so much lately has really made it more difficult for me to sleep and be calm, and I was already like this the months before George Floyd's murder. So that sucks and I don't know how well I'm dealing with it.

Between February and now, all I had wanted in life was to move to Boston so I could actually get my adult life started. But now I'm stuck at home til AT LEAST January. And I just feel stunted as an adult and as a man. I feel underdeveloped. I know a lot of people my age are in the same boat, but a lot of them at least had the chance to live on their own for a year after college. Not me. Been a loser since last May. 

Only silver lining is that I'm getting this master's degree pretty much free of charge and I will still get to move in January if the creek don't rise. But I've still barely hung out with friends since LAST September, since my job was remote, see? So it really feels as if I've been quasi-quarantining for a year now.

Before I got my current job, which Ive had for less than a year, I was in food serviceso I really feel like I dodged a bullet. Im working from home. Financially Im doing fine. But I struggled with mental illness before this and I am finding it totally impossible to do my work the way I should.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/02/28/i-have-coronavirus-so-far-it-isnt-that-bad/

But in case of a paywall I thought I'd paste the text for you.



**I have the coronavirus. And it hasnt been that bad.**

I am in my late 60s, and the sickest Ive ever been was when I had bronchitis several years ago. That laid me out on my back for a few days. This has been much easier: no chills, no body aches. I breathe easily, and I dont have a stuffy nose. My chest feels tight, and I have coughing spells. If I were at home with similar symptoms, I probably would have gone to work as usual.

I caught the virus on the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that was quarantined outside Yokohama for 14 days, at the end of a 16-day cruise I took with my wife, Jeri. When I left the ship a couple of weeks ago, I felt fine. We checked our temperatures throughout our quarantine. Jeri and I got a swab test for the virus. Our temperatures were normal; theyd get the swab results back in 48 hours. Our test results had not arrived before we boarded buses for the airport, where two U.S. government planes waited for us.

As we took off from Tokyo, I had a bit of a cough, but I chalked it up to the dry air in the cabin. I felt pretty tired  but who wouldnt, in our situation? I dozed off.

When I woke up, I had a fever. I made my way to the back of the cargo plane, where the Air Force had set up a quarantine area cordoned off with sheets of plastic. They took my temperature. It was over 103 degrees. So I took a seat in the quarantine area and fell back asleep until we touched down in California, at Travis Air Force Base.

Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention came onto the plane and said that three of us who had been cordoned off would fly to Omaha (with our spouses, if they wanted to come along). The CDC had a quarantine location at the University of Nebraskas hospital. We arrived on Feb. 17, greeted by a fleet of ambulances and police cars. Officials put me on a stretcher and wheeled me into a van, which made for a very dramatic scene. I easily could have walked myself, despite my exhaustion.

On the hospital campus, they put me in a biocontainment unit. The space was sealed off, with two double-paned windows that looked out on the hallway, and a large, heavy, insulated door. Two cameras watched me at all times; a set of computer monitors were equipped with microphones, so that the medical staff and I could communicate with CDC officials at central command down the hall. The room had last been used for the Ebola outbreak in 2014.

A doctor and nurses reviewed my case with me and took a bunch of lab tests. They wore heavy-duty hazmat suits sealed with duct tape and equipped with motors that helped with air circulation. It looked like something out of The Andromeda Strain. When the test came back a few hours later, I wasnt surprised to learn that I had the coronavirus. Later, the Tokyo swab confirmed the result  I had caught the virus even before I left the ship.

It didnt scare me too badly. I knew my number was up. The way I saw it, I was going to get stuck in at least 14 more days of quarantine, even if I didnt get the virus. So many fellow passengers had come down with the illness, including one of my friends, that Id gotten somewhat used to the idea that I might catch it, too. My wife, however, tested negative and headed to quarantine at a separate facility a few blocks away. After those days being cooped up on the ship together, I think we both relished the alone time; we still could communicate through our phones.

During the first few days, the hospital staff hooked me up to an IV, mostly as a precaution, and used it to administer magnesium and potassium, just to make sure I had plenty of vitamins. Other than that, my treatment has consisted of what felt like gallons and gallons of Gatorade  and, when my fever rose just above 100 degrees, some ibuprofen. The nurses came to the room every four hours or so, to check my vitals, ask if I needed anything and to draw my blood. I got very good at unhooking all the monitors checking my oxygen level, blood pressure and heart rate so I could go to the bathroom or just pace around the room a little, to get my blood flowing. I never quite got the hang of hooking them back up without making a tangled mess. After 10 days, I moved out of biocontainment and into the same facility as Jeri. Now we can videochat from our separate quarantines, in neighboring rooms.

As of my most recent test, on Thursday, I am still testing positive for the virus. But by now, I dont require much medical care. The nurses check my temperature twice a day and draw my blood, because Ive agreed to participate in a clinical study to try to find a treatment for coronavirus. If I test negative three days in a row, then I get to leave.

The time has passed more quickly than I wouldve expected. With my laptop, I get as much work done as I can, remotely. I catch up with friends. I take walks around my room, trying to take a thousand more steps each day. I also watch the news. Its surreal to see everyone panic  news conferences, the stock market falling, school closures  about a disease I have. It does seem likely that coronavirus will spread in the United States, but it wont help anybody if we all panic. Its true that the disease seems much more likely to be fatal for older people and those in poor health. Im relatively fortunate: Im still younger than the most at-risk groups, and Im in good shape, giving me less cause for alarm. Others who contract the virus wont be as lucky. At least six Diamond Princess passengers have died from the disease, of around 705 passengers who caught it.

Still, coronavirus doesnt have to be a horrible calamity. Based on my experience, Id recommend that everyone get a good digital thermometer, just as a comfort tool, so they can reassure themselves if their noses start running.

If you told me when I left home in January that I wouldnt be back until March  that, instead, I would be confined for more than 24 days because Id catch a novel virus at the center of what could become a pandemic  that would have completely freaked me out. But now that its happening, Im just taking it one day at a time.","COVID19_support",37,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fenuog/article_i_have_the_coronavirus_so_far_it_hasnt/"

It's hard but the stigma is just as bad","TLDR: exposed to coronavirus, developed coronavirus symptoms, had mild yet very scary experience, coronavirus test came back negative, went to the ER, doctors think it was a false negative, slowly recovering, symptoms mostly gone, finally out of isolation

I just wanted to share because there aren't many people I can talk to about this. I'm a healthy, 24-year-old female and I have coronavirus. I hung out with a friend on March 7, before all of the protective measures were in place. She got it from a coworker and I got it from her. My symptoms didn't show up until 15 DAYS LATER.

SYMPTOMS

Day 1 - slight cough, nasal and chest congestion, stomach cramps (i thought it was my period coming on...), no fever, slight fogginess/fatigue; at this point, I thought it was the early stages of a cold

Day 2 - chills at night, woke up with 100 degree fever, strange headache (it didn't hurt but intense pressure), I tried to get out of bed but quickly realized I didn't have the energy, my heart was racing as if I had just sprinted a marathon; this is when I knew I had acquired coronavirus; those symptoms only lasted 10-15 mins. With this virus, it's off and on - something new every day.

Day 3 - no cough, no fever, hard to breathe due to chest and nasal congestion, I have to take deep breaths like I'm meditating; my doctor assured me that these are mild symptoms, and I believe her. I've been well enough to work and do normal things. The symptoms only get bad at night when it's difficult to catch my breath.

TAKEAWAYS - This is nothing like I've ever experienced. Coronavirus is unique because it affects your upper and lower respiratory tracts. I know I'll be fine - the key is staying calm, doing some deep breathing exercises, rest, hydrate, and medicate. But I see how this is dangerous for older adults and adults living with chronic illnesses/conditions.

TESTING - It hurts like hell to get the coronavirus test. They stick a long wire deep in your nose for 15 seconds. It burns. I cried. I get my results back in 4-7 days but I know I have it. Get tested if you can!

ANXIETY - I'm afraid I may have passed it to my mom and my little sister during the two weeks that I was asymptomatic. Every day is a waiting game. I feel so guilty even though I haven't intentionally done anything. I worked from home. I isolated when they told us to. Yes, I still had a few one-on-one hangouts early on. No, I didn't think they would come back to haunt me.

STIGMA - It's almost as bad as the virus itself. I feel embarrassed, I feel ashamed, I feel like I didn't socially distance well enough, I feel like I can't tell my friends or my coworkers. I don't want their judgment. Social media shamers have made it worse (people who mean well but are posting things that are deeply stigmatizing) - it creates an ""us vs them"" environment.

UPDATE - 5/6/20

**Before I write about the rest of my experience, I want to apologize if this post made anyone anxious. I didn't realize this wasn't the right group, and I should've looked around more before posting.**

Day 4 - didn't feel any better, didn't feel any worse; mentally and physically tired

Day 5 - tossed and turned all night (it's always worse at night) due to bad chest congestion, bad chest pressure, shortness of breath, stomach cramps, mild coughs; I woke up that morning with the worst headache I've ever experienced, very low energy, bad stomach ache; This was the worst I've felt so far; I slept most of the day; I was afraid that this was the ""turning point"" that so many reference before ending up in the hospital

Day 6 - a freaking great day, I woke up feeling so good, which is weird because the day before was the worst; I thought it was finally over

Day 7 - experienced real shortness of breath, like I hadn't experienced before; rapid heart rate; couldn't do anything but stay in bed; this was a sad day

Days 8-12 - I stopped journaling because I was too depressed; being sick during a global pandemic really messes with your mental state

SOMETHING UNEXPECTED HAPPENED - MY TEST CAME BACK NEGATIVE

The doctors told me to go to the ER. Nobody could figure out what my symptoms were or why my test came back negative. They told me that it was likely a false negative and that given my symptoms, I likely do have coronavirus and should continue to isolate. One nurse told me that my viral load was likely too low for the test to pick up the virus - this isn't surprising because I'm generally healthy and young. They decided not to do another test because I was getting better and a 2nd test wouldn't have changed my treatment. Also, those tests are expensive and labs are already at capacity - better to save that test for someone who actually needs it.

TODAY (15 days since my first symptoms appeared) - I'm slowly getting better. Every day I feel more and more like myself, but recovery hasn't been linear. Some days I'm very fatigued. Some days I feel completely fine. The important things is, most of my symptoms are gone. I'm finally out of isolation. I can play with my little sister again (my family is all fine, it's been 2+ weeks and no one is sick). Every time I breathe I'm so grateful. I went for two weeks without being able to take a deep breath. 10 days isolated in my room with no contact. There were nights I was convinced I wouldn't wake up - and my symptoms were ""MILD"".

Overall, I feel very blessed and lucky to be alive. My heart goes out to everyone who has it worse.  The fact that my test came back negative was a cruel twist. But maybe it was a blessing in disguise. Having a low viral load could be the reason none of my friends or family members got sick. But what are the chances that I got a virus that mimics the same disease occurring during a global pandemic?

If anything, this will make a hell of a story to tell one day. I hope you all are doing well.

HERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT MADE IT SLIGHTLY BETTER FOR ME

Humidifier, chest rub, pulse oximeter and thermometer (checking my vitals every hour helped my peace of mind), acetaminophen, guaifenesin, sims 4, chicken noodle soup, deleting social media, not checking the news, becoming a workaholic &lt;3","COVID19_support",120,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fp2coh/im_24_with_coronavirus_its_hard_but_the_stigma_is/"
"2020-09-09",1599660942,"Online school sucks.","My entire school is online this semester and I hate it so much. I feel so terrible every day. Everything about this situation is horrible.

First off, I have so much trouble focusing during class. I've tried everything- creating a separate ""work space"" in my room, taking notes of everything the professor says, putting my phone at the other end of the room during class: none of it works. My mind always ends up wandering and I can never pay attention. I didn't have this problem at all when I was at school.

My friends that I made at school last year and I don't really talk online much, and when we do facetime or whatever, it never feels the same as real life and it just leaves me feeling empty. I have two friends from high school that i still talk to, but they don't really talk to me when they're at school because they have friends they like better. I feel so lonely.

All of my professors so far are talking about things that they used to do with their classes, like field trips, guest speakers, etc. and how we're not gonna be able to do those things. I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of big experiences for my major. This semester is the most intense one for my major as well (I already have four big projects assigned to me) and I don't have access to any of the labs or materials I would have been if I was on campus. I'm afraid my portfolio is going to suffer because of it.

All of my professors and the people in my classes are so nice, and Im never gonna have the same connection I did with them if I were on campus. I doubt theyre gonna remember me when we go back, and I go to a competitive school where networking is important. And honestly, I just like school and talking to my professors and its just not the same.

Also, i just miss being on campus. I miss having independence. I was going to school in my dream city, it was such an amazing place to be. I was able to walk out of campus and basically do anything I wanted to do. I also had a lot more freedom to express myself in the way I wanted. Now that I'm at home, I have no freedom at all.  I can't dress the way I want, or even cut my hair the way I want. I can't do anything without asking my parents first, and it fucking sucks. I'm stuck in the closet as well so I cant be who I am at all.

I've cried every day for like the past couple of days about it and I just feel so overwhelmed. I fucking hate this so much. I wish I just would've taken a gap year or something, even if that would've put me a year behind my friends.  My mental health has been completely spiraling since the beginning of COVID and I don't see it getting better anytime soon.","COVID19_support",41,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/ipgo5r/online_school_sucks/"
"2020-03-07",1583541832,"For those with health anxiety","I have severe health anxiety with OCD. Yay!

I did counselling a while back and thought Id share some tips.

1. Everyone is worried, but some have better self-soothing coping mechanisms. We need to up our game with the self-soothing. 

2. One really important breakthrough in therapy for me was to understand that people can get through illness (even serious) and keep living a fulfilled life. I was in panic-catastrophising-doom mode and my brain wasnt working properly - I was convinced my life was over...without being ill!

We dont know enough about the virus yet to know whats going to happen. We dont know how it is going to personally affect us and we cant control that anymore than what were already doing. Yes, it could kill us, that is a possibility. But theres lots of things in life that can kill us and we dont obsess over them. By continuing to search online, you are trying to control whats going to happen to you, but you cant (because youve already done all you can). 

3. Stop looking online. Youve likely prepped in every way possible. You know you will self isolate if you get sick. You know every precaution possible now. Looking at coronavirus subreddits is just carrying on the cycle of your fear and taking you out of whatever youre doing in the moment. It could even be your minds version of escapism - I know it is for me. Its a way to make my mind obsess and worry over something out of control. But the best coping mechanism is self-soothing. 

4. Identify what makes you feel better and do it as soon as you feel anxious (if you can). Baths, reading, listening to music, reaching out to friends. Take this time as a time to look after yourself and prioritise yourself. Treat yourself as if youre already unwell (which we are as mental illness is very real) and you need to wind down a bit and do things to make yourself feel better. Learn to believe you deserve to self soothe and you deserve to switch off from scary things. For me, I have a maladaptive belief that if I keep thinking about something constantly, I am keeping myself prepared. Actually what Im doing is keeping my body in a constant state of anxiety that will make it harder for me to fight a potential infection. Self soothing is a preventative measure! 

And finally...

Heres an exercise I did in therapy. It makes you challenge your beliefs and rationalise them. 

Belief if I get seriously ill, people wont believe me or theyll be angry

Evidence for (valid childhood traumas that triggered the health anxiety in the first place):

- Other kids thought I was faking it to skip school

- People would get annoyed at me cancelling 

- Some people got frustrated 

- Lost out on jobs and opportunities 

- Saw my sister not be believed with her long term health condition and it took her years to be diagnosed

Evidence against:

- Took time off work and boss was fine

- Kids who got angry with me had their own issues and got angry with a lot of people for other things

- I am not responsible for other peoples reactions, nor can I control them 

- Peoples frustration is often with the health anxiety itself

New belief

If I get seriously ill, it wont necessarily make people angry. I can help myself more than I think. I can develop a support network

Ill try and do it with coronavirus:

This is going to cause a global pandemic with serious implications. Im not going to have fun for months, could drag out years. Im going to lose my job if I have to self isolate. I wont be able to pay rent. I could die or someone I love could die

Evidence for:

- Bad job 

- Higher mortality rate than flu

- Countries going into lockdown

- Scary stories emerging 

- Hospitals wont be able to cope 

- Always get badly ill with respiratory infections

Evidence against:

- There will be other jobs. Maybe work from home online jobs will pop up as the economy adapts 

- Lower mortality rate than SARS

- Most people have mild symptoms 

- Landlords will have to accept late payments 

- Sensationalist headlines from news outlets that dont have the full picture yet who generate clicks out of fear 

- If I self isolate, I can do that hobby Ive always wanted to do - play more guitar, write a book, watch every Netflix series. Its a chance to reevaluate whats important in my life 

- One year of no holidays is nothing compared to all the holidays Ill go on in the rest of my life 

It is scary, there are no doubts about that. But after coronavirus, there will be something else to be scared about. Before coronavirus, there was world war three in January!

Once I stopped worrying I had cancer, I started worrying I had a brain tumour. You need to tackle the anxiety itself.

Belief I am going to get ill and die

Reality anxiety about potential events I have no control over is ruling and ruining my life right now

The best thing you can do for yourself right now is treat your anxiety because thats the biggest threat to you, as its stopping you going about your daily life with a healthy mind.

"2020-12-14",1607978994,"Does anyone else feel that there is a toxic culture surrounding the lockdowns?","I'd like to first preface that I do understand how severe and dangerous this virus is. This is not an anti-lockdown post, as they can be very effective in helping keep down the severity of this pandemic. This is more of a post about my frustrations with the handling of the lockdown and how I feel a toxic culture has developed around it. Also, I'm a total dumbass, this is not a scientific paper, just a rant.

I'm going to start off with how the messaging around this pandemic has, I think, been terrible. In the US at least, most of what we hear from politicians is ""don't see people, stay home"" which worked well for about two weeks but it's been 9 months and the messaging hasn't changed. Anyone with any sort of social life can't survive off zoom calls for a year. If these people honestly think a majority of people will isolate themselves this long without any incentive they're delusional. Telling people to ""Not go out"" is on the same level as telling teenagers to ""not have sex"" it's just not going to work. People need human contact, it's in our DNA, we know that isolation leads to depression. Can these politicians stop acting like this is easy.

Next are the productivity shamers. This has mostly died down but I still have a couple of family members and friends who do this. Where they ask ""what have you done with this lockdown"", it's so patronizing. Aunt Debora, I'm really happy that you've gotten into painting this year but I am holding on by a thread and I don't have the energy to get into pottery, so stop shaming me for it! The people doing this are so detached from reality and have no idea what people are going through. I mean there are people like me who are just too sad to do anything, and maybe yeah I deserve a little shame. But I know other people who are busier than ever during all of this. I have a friend who's working practically a full-time job while also attending university, do you really expect him to have learned how to play the fucking ukulele?

Lastly are the lockdown worshippers. Again nothing against the lockdowns, they can be very useful, but lockdowns do cause a lot of damage that people are just not willing to acknowledge and it's frustrating. Every time I hear someone say ""you're just being asked to watch Netflix all day"" It makes me want to ram my head into a fucking brick wall. How delusional do you have to be to think that's all this is? It shows how privileged they really are, it's almost as if they've never seen a poor person in their life. I've been lucky and have not had any financial troubles during all of this. But this is still hard, I suffer from anxiety and depression and I've lost a lot of my coping mechanisms and support systems, and there been challenging times for me throughout these months. Then there are other people I know who are losing jobs, being evicted, or losing their businesses. They have been given no assistance by the government and are struggling to make it day to day. Stop acting like these lockdowns have no consequences, or that they are easy, they're hard. Yet still hear people saying that people are ""selfish"" for missing going out with their friends, for wanting to keep their business afloat, it's not selfish. Again I'm all for helping to stop the spread of the virus but can people stop with the virtue signaling ""I've been isolating since march and I'm ok"" good for you, but please please stop guilt-tripping all of us, for most of us this has been very difficult, and I'm sick of having the real issues of me and my friends and family be trivialized.

Mainly making this post because I've had these frustrations over the past few months and was wondering if anyone else felt similar.  Again, not an expert, I'm not smart and this is just a dump of my emotions. If you read all of it I appreciate it, and I hope you all can get through this ok. My heart goes out to those who have had to see someone they care about get sick with the virus.

"2020-03-22",1584841462,"Something that helped me","I don't know of anyone else here has touched upon this. But it helped put some things into perspective for me:

This is the FIRST worldwide pandemic occurring during mass social media. 

Sars was back in 2003, before Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit even existed. H1N1 even occurred in the baby years of those sites.

There is so much information, misinformation, fear mongering, lies, etc. being constantly shoved into our faces that it's turned into one big overwhelming mess. 

Every news site wants to be at the forefront, to the point they will print misinformation stretching to outright lies. Most will get more and more outrageous to compete with one another for that viewcount. 

Just remember that Doctors and Scientists all over the world are working around the clock to not only find a vaccine, but better ways to manage symptoms. The best way you can help is by maintaining social distancing to give them that needed time.

Take breaks from social media, find things to better occupy your mind, get some physical activity, be safe, wash your hands, and of course stay home / avoid places people normally congregate.

"2020-09-06",1599351414,"frustrated and grieving","I'm a 20-year-old full-time college student. My family has taken COVID SO seriously since we all got sent home from our universities in march. My dad was so worried about getting sick he only left the house to go to work and my mom only left to get groceries. My sisters and I were at home 24/7 till June when I had to go to my college apartment to work + do summer classes remotely in a place where I had my own room (I shared my room with 2 other sisters). After I left I came back home just in time for fathers day, celebrated with my dad...not knowing that would be the last time I saw him alive. I went back to my apartment not knowing my whole family would catch COVID that same week...from my dad who caught it at work...from a co-worker who went to the beach a week prior. My dad did everything he could to protect us. His job didn't allow him to work from home, but he took all the safety precautions we were told (mask, gloves, lots of hand sanitizer). I lost my dad to a virus people aren't taking seriously. It's so frustrating to see people treat this as a joke....especially where I'm from (south Florida). Everything is a reminder of what I've lost. Being stuck inside makes grieving so much more difficult. My mom and sisters have antibodies but since I never got sick (my test was negative) I don't have any. Because my dad was the only one who worked, my mom and I now have to expose ourselves to be able to support our family. I'm so mad at everything....I'm so mad at the world and I don't know how to cope. I don't know how to keep going through the fall semester, both because of what happened to my dad, and being in quarantine has taken such a toll on my mental health.

As a result, I've been more cautious than most people my age (23). My friends are all hanging out, going out like normal, and not being cautious. Some of them call me paranoid or don't understand why I'm cautious. I'm an analytic overthinker, so I won't hang out with someone if I consider their job unsafe or know that they've been with a lot of people.

I have been seeing only one person non-distance wise because he is a loner who works from home. I just found out that he was with someone who was on a plane recently, and that person has been in close contact with a person who has gone on multiple Tinder dates. Long story short, now I can't see the one person who I've been seeing every week (at least in a non-distance way). This makes me feel sad.

I remember in January being frustrated by the ""just a flu bro"" folks when I knew that it wasn't just a flu. I started staying at home before lockdowns were put in place in my state. So I know and understand the importance of staying at home as much as possible.

But lately, I've been seeing a lot of people (especially here on reddit) begin to get hostile about calling for people to stay at home. It seems like everything--even just news articles--have scores of draconian ""stay the fuck home"" voices in the comment section. Talk about safe ways of getting outside? Stay the fuck home. Talk about driving to your mom's to drop off food from a distance? Stay the fuck home. Talk about reopening things slowly and safely? Stay the fuck home. That's their answer to everything.

For some people, being able to stay at home is a luxury. There are other people (some of whom are friends of mine) who are facing homelessness right now because rent and bills are still due and they can't work. There are others who have struggled with clinical depression their whole lives and who are now contemplating suicide for the first time in years. There are others who are in abusive or negative situations at home who now have no escape.

So I wish the totalitarian calls to stay home would stop. To me, those just reek of privilege and virtue-signaling.

"2020-04-07",1586222538,"My 31 year old brother was given 2 more days to live. And the Doctor wants me family to make a difficult choice.. I can't bear it.","His ICU doctor has changed about 4 times now. This current doctor I've met before on a pharmacy rotation at one of the network hospitals almost 3  years ago. He's a hard military man who got out of active duty and now works in critical care. He was cold and unforgiving when I was a student, and when I talked to him today, he's about the same.

My older brother (I'm 26) went to the hospital March 25th with COVID like symptoms and then intubated the day after he was admitted with a fever of 102F. Everyday I asked the hospital staff information about his labs, his breathing progression, his kidneys, organs, medications, any information that would help me understand how he was progressing.

I could tell by the labs and his breathing that he really didn't improve much. It's been about 10 days and he's still on a ventilator. They now found blood in his endotracheal tube. The doctor told me that bleeding in patients is easy to treat if it's caused by cancer/tumors, or other external factors, but the fact that he's bleeding means he is bleeding in his lungs. The infection is getting more severe even with antibiotics for ventilator associated pneumonia.

So today he asked me...  to try and decide. I asked him how much time does my brother have left? He said give or take one or two days. I can't even leave my military base (in Oklahoma) right now to go back to my family (in Pennsylvania) because I still need permission from the General Commander.. My mom tested positive for COVID March 19th and she's technically still on quarantine with my dad who was negative.  My mom has been begging me not to come because she doesn't want to see me get sick and end up like my brother. But I told her that I need to come home, I don't think the hospital staff will let me see him but if he... passes... I want to see his body at least.

The doctor said we can either

1. continue to let him stay sedated... see if he can try to continue to fight his infections. He would need to significantly improve in a matter of a day or two, if he doesn't then he's probably going to... pass away... sedated, while trying to fight.
2. wake him up. say our last good byes.

I'm scared to have to make a decision. I talked to his boyfriend and he told me that my brother would want to keep fighting. I want him to fight too  but I know my mom wants to say bye, but we can't go into the hospital to say goodbye. It would have to be over video call... He would die alone in the hospital without anyone. he would be woken up after 10-14 days of being asleep and being suddenly told ""we can't save you. Say good bye forever."" I can't bear it. I'm falling apart at the seems. For anyone who's reading this thank you for reading it all. I would like for anyone to tell me if they had to make a hard decision like this before or if they lost anyone and what it was like. I've never lost a family member before... I am just totally lost. Thank you.

tldr; older brother,31 relatively healthy ended up on a ventilator for 10-12 days. doctor told my family either we let him keep fighting for 1-2 more days to see if he gets better, if not he will die regardless or we wake him up and say good bye remotely from phone call.

Hi, I grew up with hippie activist parents, and we were low-key preppers. Because of this I have done zero shopping for the COVID19 pandemic. We just already have everything on hand.

To try and help people, I wanna share how we live at my house, and how we shop.

Step 1 - don't freak out and go grab everything all at once. The supply chain in most places is not screwed yet, there will be food arriving for quite some time. It also promotes un-needed panic to see carts overflowing with hoarded food and empty shelves. ""Why should I care if I get mine...?"" Well because if you provoke a panic in a grocery store, you may NOT get yours. Also, if others panic and go into selfish mass hoarding mode, there may be no ""yours"" left to get!

Step 2 -instead budget between $5 to $20 each shopping trip. In our city most places stock overnight and get raided like crazy in the morning. So plan to send a family member as the store opens, before work. Each of you can prevent panic-provoking by splitting up and checking out separately. So if you want 5 bags of dry beans, you get 2 and your spouse gets 3 in a different line. Please be socially conscious and do this, it really does help.

Step 3 - each shopping trip, have 2 lists - one of the perishable things you'll use in the next week, and a ""stock up"" list that you won't use at all, until needed. Budget that extra $10 or so, to grab stuff on the stock-up list.

Step 4 - here's what we keep on hand, as a general rule. ! gallon cooking oil, one can crisco, one box iodized salt. Assorted herbs and spices. Lots of garlic powder and hot pepper flakes -natural preservatives that also kill some bacteria in food.

2 containers boullion cubes. 25+ lbs flour, cornmeal, dried mixed beans, and rice. A month's meals worth of dried or canned veggies. Canned or powdered milk. Canned meats. Whole wheat pasta. 5 lb bag of baking powder from Sam's, and baking soda. Cream of tartar.

&amp;#x200B;

Eggs, which will keep a month in the fridge. Will keep much longer if you rub their shells with lard and bury them under a layer of salt in your pantry. Old pioneer ""no refrigerator"" trick. Get a couple gallons of food grade vinegar - apple cider and white both. Not only is it a good preservative, it's a badass cleaning and laundry cleaning product.

If you have fresh veggies about to go bad, STOP WASTING THEM. Every single veg can either be cut thin and go into the oven on a tray with some salt, to dehydrate, or go into a jar and have boiling salted vinegar poured over them, then put in the fridge as refrigerator pickles.

Get some borax and washing soda, and bulk bars of dial soap. Not only is it cheaper to stock up on than detergent, it disinfects better and you can make 5 gallons of detergent from 1 bar of soap, 1 cup of soda, 1 cup of borax. 17 cents a gallon cost to you.

Step 5 - learn to cook pioneer one pot meals. [All](https://Allrecipies.com)recipes[.com](https://Allrecipies.com) has plenty of recipes. You can DM me for my crock pot recipes. Don't go buy a pressure cooker or instapot if you don't already have one. You'd be better off to get a cheap crock pot and a food dehydrator. Although you can dehydrate foods and make jerky in a 200F oven easily.

Don't be intimidated by learning to cook. Homemade gravy is fat, flour, water or chicken broth or milk, some meat crumbles and black pepper, and a spoonful of cornstarch if you're in a hurry; a bit of stirring and bam, gravy. Even lumpy beginner-made gravy tastes goooood.

Learn to make 5 ingredient bread. If you DM me I will set up a video call on discord with you and walk you through it, if that's what it takes :)

Soak beans and rice overnight and give the water to your houseplants or garden, before cooking. The grains will cook faster and more tender, and the beans will be de-gassed. Rinse before cooking, then fill with an inch more water than rice or beans and simmer on the stove or crock pit  til tender. Ham, onions, canned crushed tomatoes, some canned lil smokies sausage... mmmmm. One pot to clean, heckin good healthy filling food.

You can get so many of these ""staples"" for SO MUCH cheaper than pre-packaged, pre-processed foods.

Now, about toilet paper. Don't bother. Go to Lowe's or Home Depot, and get a 5 gallon lidded bucket for each bathroom. Get bleach, ammonia, or peroxide. Buy squares of cloth. Could be washrags, ""shop towels"" or ""dust cloths"" - you want a woven cotton thing happening here. No plushy texture synthetics. You can also just cut up old t-shirts. Or if the hoarders have hit, go to a craft store and get cotton t-shirt fabric. Make a ""diaper pail"" of a bucket filled 1/2 way with bleachwater, ammonia water, or peroxide water. DO NOT MIX ANY OF THESE CHEMICALS, PICK ONE.

Get a spray bottle and put water, 1 drop of dish soap, 1 spoon of witch hazel. When you go bathroom, spray off your undercarriage then wipe with a damp cloth. Cloth goes in the lidded bucket. Once a week, dump the bucket into the washer with a 1/2 cup of bleach and run it on heavy duty. You never see, smell, or touch anything icky. I grew up this way and we went back to in in 2020 on New Year's to help #teamtrees. Once you get past the mental block of it, you may never go back.

I grew up in a literal pioneer log cabin, gardening, raising egg and meat birds, milking dairy goats. I still live partly that way. We went shopping once a month and barely bought anything.

Both my husband and I fought like heck to live through 2019 and for him it carries into 2020. We both left 2019 with scars and then Covid-19 came along. Edit to correct year. 

February 2019 I was induced at 37 weeks with our son due to pre-eclampsia. This pregnancy was anything but smooth sailing. After 30 hours of labor both my son and I became distressed. I blacked out during my c-section and thought I died. I almost did. I ended up with severe blood loss after they were nearly unable to stop my bleeding due to low platelet count. We both survived, I endured PPD but we got through it. 

November 2019 My husband went into surgery to have a large mass removed from his pancreas. They has been unable to biopsy it before surgery. They ended up taking the mass, 2/3 of his pancreas and his spleen. He has an 11 inch scar from breast to navel. He became septic 10 days after the surgery. He went septic 3 more times in the span of 5 months. There were days I really thought I was going to become a single parent. Things started to turn around when they found two holes in his stomach which were causing the sepsis. He had gastric juices flooding his chest cavity. He had a drain for 4 months, came home with a feeding tube but he lived. He cut it close. He lost 5 months with our son. His last stay was 28 days and he was discharged March 13, 2020. 

Then we were put on lockdown. I was kept on pay roll but sent home. I'm a school bus driver so our contracts were honored until June. My husband is an essential worker so 2 weeks after getting home he had to go back to work during this Pandemic. We have been fortunate and I am grateful. But now I've been out of work for two months without receiving unemployment. I probably don't have a job to return to. My husband and I are at risk if we get Covid-19. We have an 18 month old and we've already faced so much together. 

I HATE COVID-19! I hate the lack of empathy people have for those who have died. I hate the self centered people who think this is a joke. I don't know how we can sustain the path we are taking. I feel so hopeless. What will the world look like for the children? I feel like I'm in a bad sci-fi movie. The daily anxiety and episodes of depression. I'm desperately grasping the thread bare pieces of hope I still have.

For many months the facility managed to get extremely lucky and testing kept coming back negative across the board, week after week. Staff and residents get tested 2x a week.

Well that shit went up in smoke a few weeks ago and the virus snuck in and ripped through us like wildfire and we've since lost several residents and virtually the entire facility is now a red zone.

I started feeling run down 4 or 5 days ago and a bunch of symptoms emerged: sore throat, flu-ish chills and body aches, intermittent low fever. And then yesterday, seemingly out of nowhere, I realized I couldn't taste any element of the casserole I was eating. Like, nothing. 

Needless to say my most recent test came back positive. I live in a tiny house with my wife and two children. I have no way to protect them. I can't afford to live out of a hotel. There's no basement or spare bedroom that I can even attempt to quarantine in. My wife reported my positive to her employer and she's getting a rapid test tomorrow but will be unable to work for at least a few days. 

My employer says I can work in the red zone if I feel well enough. ... ... ... It's so aggravating. Like, there's no support financially. I'm ""allowed"" to call-in and use PTO or take off unpaid. I'm very low on PTO because I've had to use a lot recently to help flesh out some low-hour days on my paychecks because HOLY FUCK PREPARE FOR THIS REVELATION: turns out that elderly folk sick with COVID don't particularly want to get out of bed and exercise! Who knew??

I feel powerless and frustrated. I hate that I directly endanger my family on a daily basis. I hate that I am not afforded the opportunity to rest at home without constant financial stress. I hate that I live in a red state that is filled people that voted for four more years of Trump, a significant percentage of which still think COVID is fake news.

Today was the 4th brief errand run: 4th grocery trip, at a store with masks required and other limits. 2nd gas fill up, 3rd pharmacy drive through, ATM.

My state recently opened, too early in my opinion. Traffic today felt like before the pandemic. Parking lots of retail centers were positively slammed. An electronics store I was interested in quickly stopping at for one item had a 60-customer limit, yet still had a small wait outside. I saw that and just drove on! The masks were almost the only hint of things being not 100% normal.

Does anyone else feel weird about suddenly seeing so many people engaged in so much nonessential activity in such crowded spaces, often without masks? When the streets were empty, I felt normal not wanting to be out on them, either; but now I see news segments showing crowded bars in other states? Would it not be *more* dangerous to be out now?  Part of me says I'm still OK for my quick trips for essentials, and that these people are nuts...but of course, while you're out and about, you just see the others who are out, and not the people who stayed in.

He is in his early 60s, but has kidney disease and has been on the transplant list for about a year now. He is also diabetic, although hes no longer been overweight for the past few years and his diabetes was well managed. 

He had been extremely careful and socially distant - working from home and only going out to grocery shop every few weeks during the senior hours. But somehow still contracted it. We think he may have been exposed by a maintenance worker who came by after New Years to work on a plumbing issue.

He was hospitalized, idk, almost 3 weeks ago now. At first, he was getting better. Still on lots of oxygen, but he was able to leave the ICU after the first week and his condition remained stable. I was able to FaceTime him about a week ago and he was clearly exhausted and had lost a lot of weight, but in a good mood and being his normal self. Joking around with the nurses and chatting about being happy to eat after several days on the IV drip.

Suddenly, his condition took a turn for the worst over the weekend. He wasnt responding well to the first round of dialysis and had developed pneumonia in both lungs. He was moved back to the ICU on Saturday. This morning I received news that he has been put on a ventilator because he was really struggling to breathe as a result of the pneumonia.

My Dad was eligible to get the vaccine, but there werent any available in his area at the time. Like, if he could just hold on a little longer, hed have been vaccinated and everything would have been fine.

"2020-11-24",1606206776,"My experience saying NO to the in-laws for Thanksgiving week, and the aftermath of saying no","For context, my wife and I both (mid 30s) live in Northern California. We recently got pushed back to the purple tier. My wife comes from a big family. She has never missed a Thanksgiving with her family. Suffice it to say, their bond is super tight. I, on the other hand, come from a very small family where we didn't always have grand get-togethers every Thanksgiving, so I knew this year was going to be extra difficult for my wife.

&amp;#x200B;

About 9 days ago, my wife's parents called her (they live about 2.5 hours away) and said one of their household members has been in contact with someone who may or may not have COVID, because that person was around someone who tested positive for COVID. We immediately cancelled our plans to spend Thanksgiving weekend at their place. It was a tough blow on my wife. Her sister from SoCal also cancelled. We'll call this sister Jen.

&amp;#x200B;

Not long later, Jen sent my wife a text saying they might like to come up to our house for the week. Jen and her husband are in their early 30s. They have 3 kids ranging from almost 4 to about 14. This was before CA hit purple. At the time, I agreed that if they wanted to, they could come visit us during the week of Thanksgiving break, although a part of me knew that it probably was not the brightest idea. However, Jen herself seemed hesitant; she was asking just in case. She had mentioned that they took time off work and have been experiencing cabin fever in Orange County, so maybe a few days out here would do them some good. At the time I said yes because I didn't want to be the bad guy and I figured Jen would eventually decide not to come. After all, the risks just aren't worth the rewards.

&amp;#x200B;

The following day or so, Northern California hit purple, and we were right back to square one. Jen called and said they wouldn't come. They had made plans to visit San Francisco (and staying with us during the week). but maybe now it would be pointless as there would be even less to do with the shelter in place back in play. I was relieved.

&amp;#x200B;

Then this past Thursday night Jen texted my wife mid-day saying she was thinking about coming. My wife talked to Jen around 9 PM Thursday and Jen basically said ""Yes, actually, we are still coming."" Because I had given Jen my blessing to visit earlier in the week, Jen took me up on my offer. So the plan was for Jen, her husband and 3 kids to stay with us from Sunday to Friday 11/22-11/27. As they were talking on the phone, my wife looked at me like ""That's OK right?"" I didn't have the heart or courage then and there to say no.

&amp;#x200B;

So I stewed quietly in bed, processing everything.  It was bad enough that they were going to come see us for 5 days with no masks and no social distancing, but I found out that Thursday night they were going to stay at a friend's place from Friday-Sunday since that friend is on the way to our house. Thankfully, that was the final straw that broke this camel's back. I knew then that, as hard as it was, I had to shut down this deadly operation. The crazy thing was, they were already packed and ready to head to the friend's house first thing Friday morning!

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, I didn't have much time. Time was of the utmost essence. I laid there in bed unable to sleep. Trying to rationalize it and tell myself ""don't be a party pooper"" ""My wife misses her family dearly"" ""it would be fun to hang out and have somewhat of a normal Thanksgiving"" but I could never shut out the logical voice in my head that said, ""If you allow this to happen on your watch, someone could die.""

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I ended up sending my sister in law Jen a long text at 2:45 AM, basically stating my sorrow that we can't host them this year due to the pandemic reaching all-time highs. I expressed my deepest regret that I was telling her this at the very last second, and that I ruined her plans (both she and the husband took precious time off work that they can now never get back). I also know Jen was sick of the house in SoCal, and she needed a break from home and work. I felt bad for shutting her down at the last minute, and my wife was sad too but she understood.

&amp;#x200B;

Jen texted back at 3 AM saying it's ok, we understand. Thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

The following day my wife sent Jen a text. We did not hear back from Jen all of Friday. That was unusual to say the very least.

&amp;#x200B;

Then Saturday Jen responded and said sorry, she thought she sent her text. She reiterated that it was ok and that they ended up cancelling the whole trip. I was so glad to hear it. I knew the 5 of them staying with us for 5 days was too risky and a risk not worth taking. Honestly, I was shocked that they even had it in mind to visit two different households back to back. If I had allowed them to do that, if they were sleeping in our guest rooms as I type this, I would probably hate myself deeply. Sometimes you just have to put your foot down. Sometimes it's just not wise to congregate.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel a lot better now. I'm glad I shut everything down before we could look back on this week with regret and remorse. It's now early Tuesday morning, 12:28 AM. My wife is sleeping soundly, and the house is as quiet as a mouse. I am so thankful her family isn't here. Not because I dislike hosting them -- I enjoy it -- but because the risks were too high and in the end I know I made the right decision, even as hard as it was. I have zero regrets and feel so at peace for speaking up and shutting things down before it was too late. And boy, did I cut it close. But better late than never, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Curious if anyone has similar stories or experiences to share as Thanksgiving rapidly approaches?

&amp;#x200B;

BTW... I now dread Christmas. I was able to shut down my wife's family for Thanksgiving, but Christmas will be the real battle. I do not feel gathering would be wise... and I think a month from now things will be even worse because of people's choices over the next handful of days.

She has me tap around my face, feel my throat... we discuss medical history. Finally, she says that I have ""Suspected COVID"". It's exactly how it sounds. They suspect me of having the Coronavirus. In spite of this, I am told that I do not meet the criteria for testing. I ask what the criteria is. I'm told in her opinion it is more or less appearing to need immediate hospitalization, severely compromised respiratory system, having a major health problem (cancer as an example), or being elderly.

Now, I understand why it is so important to test those people, but there has to be space and tests to test the rest of us. Now, in order for myself and my spouse to do the right thing and self quarantine, which is what she recommended that we both do; my spouse will have to lose out on two weeks worth of hours and pay at work. My spouse is considered an Essential worker and is exposed to the public every shift with no safe guards to limit exposure apart from a pair of rubber gloves. My spouses employer will not even allow the use of masks. My spouses employer will only approve paid leave if there is a confirmed case of Covid-19 in our household. It can't be confirmed if I can't get tested. I can't get tested because I don't meet the criteria.

Bills keep piling up, especially for renters like us, but there is no relief.  Hours have already been cut because of lack of business, and now the little money that was coming in and barely sustaining us, will have to be cut off so that we can do the responsible thing and stay home. Oh, yea, and rent is due in three days.

All we can think to do is stay inside, pray this passes for us quickly and without one of us requiring hospitalization, hope we can avoid eviction and try to dig ourselves out of debt when my spouse is able to return to work. Then we have to hope that my spouses employer is understanding about the time taken off and does not cut hours further.

Ive moved 4 times this year, 3 of those have been cross country. I have been scrambling ever since to crawl my way back to normal.

I had covid in March. I have asthma but otherwise am healthy, and Im pretty young. Truth be told, I wouldnt have known I had it if I had not had a friend just come back from Italy that ended up sick. It started with difficulty breathing. Nothing awful, it was noticeable but I was still working out at home doing intense HIIT and was fine. Did need to use my rescue inhaler more, but it never felt scary or anything. Then a couple days later I developed a dry cough, not too bad just a bit annoying. That same day I developed a mild fever, just under 100°. It went away with ibuprofen and only lasted a day. I had some minor body aches that day and the next and then they went away. The cough cleared up after a week, the difficulty breathing continued for a few more weeks, but it never got worse or anything. I used a nebulizer and was fine, still continued my workouts at home. I have had colds that were far worse and messed me up for a longer period of time. I have noticed my allergies have been worse this summer, not sure if theres a relation or not. I tested negative 3 weeks after initial onset of symptoms, but that was the only subsequent test I had so I would likely have tested negative sooner than that if I had gotten one.  I had an unrelated lung scan a few weeks ago and my lungs are wonderful and clear, and the permanent damage they told me Id have after a nasty virus 3 years ago is completely gone. 

This isnt to say everyones experience will be like this, but I feel these stories need to be shared. We are constantly having the 30 year old dies after partying stories shoved down our throats, yet none from the loads of people who have recovered just fine, which are the vast majority. Moral of the story: be cautious, do what you feel you should to be safe, but know that typically people are not experiencing complications or even requiring healthcare for this.

"2020-12-19",1608339733,"My Dad passed from COVID and my Mom never caught it from him","I think I'm safe to assume that this year has been one of the worst years of most people's lives, mine included. I would have posted this sooner, but I'm just learning that this subreddit even existed. I'll apologize in advance for my first post being so long.

I first started hearing about COVID back in January. I'll admit, at that time, my wife was way more concerned about it than I was. It wasn't until February, when my job (I work in the IT department of a very large cancer hospital in Florida) started making preparations to move all non-essential employees off site to work from home, that I really started taking this seriously. This is also when my mother started taking it seriously as well, especially seeing me and my wife so concerned about it.

My mom and dad were together for over 40 years. Dad was a Vietnam veteran and worked part time at a car dealership. Dad worked through the suggested lockdown (how a car dealership was considered essential is beyond me, but whatever), and Mom armed him with what he needed to remain safe (as safe as a 69 year old veteran will be when not in the presence of his spouse). No judgement, but Dad fell into the ""it's just a flu"" mindset.

We did our part. Canceled Tuesday family dinners, stayed indoors and only went out when absolutely necessary, and used curbside pickup whenever possible. We would video chat often so that my parents could see and speak with our 5 year old son. And whenever we did have to venture out in public, sanitizer and masks were top priority before leaving the house.

June rolls around. I'm working from home for several months at this point, and I make my frequent, ""how ya doing"" call to Mom. She tells me that Dad is feeling kind of crappy. Coughing and a slight fever. She tries to remain optimistic, but is still cautious as she starts to distance herself and sanitize everything with which my Dad comes into contact. A few days later, she tells me his fever isn't going down and that he took himself to the ER (the walk in clinic wouldn't take him because of the fever). The hospital swabs him and sends him home, telling him to come back if the symptoms worsen.

On Father's Day he gets the positive result. He also begins having difficulty breathing and the constant dry coughing is making him panic and making it even harder for him to catch his breath. Mom takes him to the ER and they admit him. Within a day or 2, they move him to the ICU and put him on a vent. His breathing was better on the O2, but they suggested the vent to allow his body to rest. He agrees, they do it and immediately start seeing improvement in his O2 levels. A few days after that he comes off the vent and back on oxygen and he feels and sounds better than he has since this started. From there, they moved him out of ICU.

From there, it was a series of good days, and then one bad day, then a few more good, etc. Then the bad days started to outweigh the good, so they suggested going back to ICU, just in case. The day after they moved him back was when we got the news that, while he finally tested negative, his lungs were so badly scarred that the only thing that would save his life was a lung transplant (the wait list was over 200 days) and there were no guarantees that a) it would allow him to lead a normal life, and b) that the transplant would even take. They could put him back on the vent, but he would be on it for the rest of his life. Mom told him that whatever he chose had to be his decision and we were behind the choose 100%. It was then that Dad told her that he was tired and couldn't fight anymore.

They moved him to hospice since he was negative, and we were able to see him and say goodbye. I told him that I loved him and would take care of Mom and that he didn't have to worry about her. He passed on July 20th. Exactly one month after his test result.

The months following have been a lot about healing, and picking up the pieces and preparing for the next phase of our family life. When Dad first tested positive, I told my wife that in the event of a worst case scenario, I didn't want Mom living alone. I've seen people die from a ""broken heart"" and I did not want that for her (turns out Mom didn't want to live alone either). Currently, we have opened our quarantine bubble to include my Mom and are in the process of selling both of our homes and having a house built for all 4 of us to live together (with Mom having a space of her own).

If there are any positive takeaways from this it's my Dad being at peace now and not being in pain or struggling, and the fact that it is damn near miraculous that my Mom never got it. I'm starting to believe more and more in the ""blood type"" theory as she is O (I can't remember if it is pos or neg that is theorized to be more resistant) and Dad was not. I miss him every day and Im trying my hardest to be the man he was for my family. I hope I am making him proud.

"2021-07-27",1627428470,"Anyone else miss the pre covid times?","Im really missing pre covid times a lot. Ive been very depressed because I wish I had done more in the past. Now that covid is here and we are most likely going to adapt to a new normal, it makes me very very upset. 

I dont see anything good about this current time period. All I see is doom and gloom, and Im wondering if thats normal.

Ive tried working with a therapist but the progress is sluggish.

My motivation has been off and its made it hard to even get up in the morning because I wake up and realize the pandemic is still here. It feels very lonely, and like theres nothing to look forward to. 

I work from home. While I enjoy it, its also very isolating. 

Dating has been very hard for me during this time (and it was hard even before covid). 

Ive had trouble with making friends, even online. It feels like no one really has the time for friends anymore. 

My hobbies are wearing thin and Im starting to get bored of just playing chess game after chess game. I do still enjoy collecting diecast cars, but cant get them all the time. They do help bring me back to the past though, as I generally buy vintage ones. 

Im feeling defeated.","COVID19_support",114,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/osxvbz/anyone_else_miss_the_pre_covid_times/"
"2020-12-01",1606851857,"I am so tired of worrying","Every tightness I feel in my chest, every cough, every body ache, sends me into a panic. 

It's been like this since March and I'm actually exhausted. 

I'm a college student living at home with my parents and high risk sibling. They've made it clear to me - if anyone gets sick, it's my fault. If anyone dies from this, it's my fault. I would have to live with guilt for the rest of my life. 

I get where they're coming from. I love my family and I do everything I can to keep them safe.

The thing is - I rarely go out.

I'm a full time student, unemployed, and the only time I leave the house is to get groceries with my parents and just recently - a visit to offer support to a friend who attempted to take their life days prior. (Side note: They tested negative 2 days before I visited as it's mandatory for their work. We took all precautions as well. They just needed someone to be there with them.)

I want to keep everyone safe and healthy - family and strangers alike. I try to be as safe as I possibly can be. I always wear a mask, gloves, eye protection, use hand sanitizer, social distance, you name it.  Yet I still feel like I can get this stupid virus and pass it on to the people I love most. It scares the shit out of me.

This whole situation hurts. Seeing friends and family and so many others fall ill and in some cases pass when all of this could have been mitigated so long ago... I don't know whether to be infuriated or horrified. Maybe it's both. 

I just don't want to be in this constant state of fear anymore. I hate going to bed and waking up scared. My allergies feel like a death sentence. Guilt and fear is ravaging my already stressed out body and mind, I can't keep up with academics, I can barely focus on anything... This feels like the worst burn out I have ever experienced but so so so much worse. 

At this point I dont even know what to do anymore. 

It feels good to type this all out though. That's some progress at least. Things will get better with time, everything does. 

Anyway... If you got this far, thank you for hearing me out.

"2021-02-20",1613839137,"When we look back on this in years to come we will see covid as a small blip of chaos before a thriving, flourishing decade.","This is a thought that always comforts me. Time seems weird right now I know. The past year has dragged painfully, pushing people (and myself included) to their limits. When youre going through trauma, you feel like its never going to end. Think of even a horrible set of exams you have to do, and youre SO close to finishing them but your brain convinces you theyll never end? And you have a long summer of partying after them to look forward to, the relief is unbelievable when youve finished that last paper and you embrace that freedom with open arms.

The coronavirus epidemic will be the same, no matter what the media tries to convince you otherwise. Even think of this time last year just before shit hit the fan, lockdowns hadnt really begun yet. The panic hadnt set in yet. This horrible period hasnt even been a year yet. But it feels like a lot, lot longer. 

We have spend the vast majority of our lives covid and lockdown free (unless you were born in 2020 in which case I doubt you are reading this). On the scale of things, covid is a blip. We have turned the corner with the vaccines and the sun is about to come out and stay out longer every day. Every second, more and more people are becoming immune. 

And after this, my god. Things are going to be SO MUCH FUN. people are going to run into each others arms, crying with relief and joy. People are going to be smiling at strangers in supermarkets because theyll be able to see their faces again, on that first day when masks are lifted. There will be victory day parades on the streets, even if its torrential rain, people are going to be kissing strangers. Festivals are going to be extended by an extra week to make up for all the lost partying that 2020 took from us. 

There will be new kinds of events, parties, fashions, theatres, shows that we probably cant even comprehend yet. The 9-5 Monday-Friday work week will be scrapped and our relationship with work will change forever in the best possible way. Parents will be working from home to see their babies grow up. 

There will be a renaissance of new music, films, shows, art. A hug will mean so much more.  

And I think all of this will happen in the next 365 days. And we will never ever take anything for granted again. 

Guys, we are so close to the best days of our lives. Weve made it this far, we are nearly there.

"2022-01-02",1641147615,"My dad became the 1%","I lost my dad to COVID on the 29th. Nearly 63, Antivax, diehard Christian conservative republican, you know the drill. My mom and him fell sick on Nov 30th, I got it from them a week later. Im vaxxed so I recovered fine and despite some of my moms medical conditions and being unvaxxed, she recovered too. I had to call 911 on my dad on the 13th. Aside from the day he passed, that was the second hardest day of my life. He missed 3 of his childrens and a grandsons birthdays (including mine), Christmas, and also his own dads 90th birthday during his stay in the hospital and eventually on the vent.

My dad was the breadwinner of my (immediate) family. My moms been struggling so much since his passing, since she has some minor disabilities, she was a stay at home mom and now worries about finances and insurance. My siblings (Im the youngest) are all coping in their own ways, some seething in anger, some taking over the duties of planning the funeral and talking to his work company. His parents outlived their youngest son and live too far to attend his funeral and have no internet access to watch it online. 

I dont know, I just feel lost? No thoughts, head empty? Im 20 and have some major anxiety about growing up, have no job, dont know how to drive, live at home, freshman in college which I might not attend the second semester of the year because of my mental health after all of this. Dad was the person who was helping me with my anxiety about driving and teaching me how to become an adult and encouraged me in whichever path I took in school.

I know this is probably a normal emotion but I just really want to sit in the dark all day and cry while everyone else is doing something useful. So many people who knew my dad have been reaching out everyone except me. I only have one (best)friend and Im struggling to talk to her because even I dont know what to say. 

Yeah I dont know. I guess thanks for reading this. Im not religious anymore but anything with words are appreciated. If you want to do something for a random stranger, give your thanks to the ICU nurses, I know they are struggling even more than we are right now. Despite him being staunchly antivax, they tried their damned hardest to try and save him, even if there was such a slim chance of survival and low quality of life.

I love you dad, see you on the other side. =

"2020-11-10",1605006689,"I have covid symptoms. I'm starting to get better. My cats seem to have got it from me. One is better. One is not.","To make a long story short my cats are my world. I lost a child and a fiancee(miscarriage and the toll it took on her dissolved our relationship) after she left me the cat we had together and the cat i found shortly after she left became my world. Salem is the cat we had together. He is the one that seems to have turned a corner and just has some slight sneezing left over from it. Vaxis is the cat I found shortly after she left me. He is...absolutely and totally my baby. 

How I found him goes like this. After my ex left me, I found these two kittens where I live(people drop off kittens a lot here because they know the people where I live will feed them) one tabby and one jet black cat. The tabby was ultra friendly, the black cat was super standoffish. But they were brothers and let me both cuddle them(people have always said I was a cat whisperer) well I brought them in one day while I was feeling particularly down from my ex leaving me, I cuddled them both, loved on them, but knew I couldn't keep them. I put them back outside and would keep an eye on them as they worked their way into the feral colony we have around my house. 

Well one day I came home from work and found the tabby had been hit by a car. It was awful, and I gave him a proper burial, I saw no sign of the black kitten anywhere. I went to get booze or something(I'm a bit of an alcoholic due to depression and what have you). Well I got back home and saw the black kitten sitting exactly where his brother had died. I stopped my car and put it in park and walked up to him. He was skiddish but didn't run away. He just meowed up at me with a little meow which I interpreted as ""why"". I picked him up in my arms and promised him he would never want for anything again. I would spend my last money to give him the temptations treats he loves. I have spent my last 100 dollars i had in the bank to take him to the vet cause his meow was weak once. 

Now where we are now. 

I've been dealing with covid symptoms the past week, I think I'm finally starting to beat it. I'm honestly not a bit worried about myself though. Vaxis(the cat im worried about) has been breathing heavily through his mouth all day today and has mostly avoided me. He has zero interest in his treats right now which really worries me. His adopted older brother had a couple of mildly rough days(lots of sneezing, lethargy) but now seems to be fine. Just a bit ago he came down where he was hiding in the closet and let me cuddle him(and tearfully beg him not to leave me). I have Googled covid in cats and the CDC seems to say there have been no deaths. Tell me I'm just overreacting. Tell me my baby will be fine. I'm a Satanist so I don't believe in prayer but ill take any good vibes just so that my baby won't leave me.

Edit: after posting this initially I got blocked from posting here for a bit. I contacted the mods and was enabled. Currently vaxis is sitting on my lap and seems to be breathing through his nose a bit better and may even be resting(which i haven't seen him be able to comfortably do all day) please, whatever good energy is out there let him be okay.

Edit 2: since I've posted this he has totally fallen asleep in my lap. He's not breathing out of his mouth at this point and seems to be breathing deeply enough that his breaths seem to be consistent. I do plan on taking him to the vet if this persists.(I live in a very rural area so overnight vets are basically non existent here) but I'm hoping this is just me overacting and being stupid.","COVID19_support",87,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jrj708/i_have_covid_symptoms_im_starting_to_get_better/"
"2020-05-09",1589037612,"All for nothing?","So, since this whole thing started, my mom and stepdad have been super cautious. Mom, a teacher, has hardly left the house. Stepdad still has had to work. He runs a convenience store. I guess I should say they're in a small town in Kansas that hasn't been affected much. Still, he's taken precautions. Plexiglas between cashier and customer, gloves, constant cleaning - all of it. Since he's been going out, he and my mom are keeping distance from each other this whole time. Honestly, impressive resilience. 
My brother and his family have not been cautious. At all. Continuing with vacation plans in early April, and hosting friends visiting from out of state, among other things. I know where he gets his news, and so as not to alienate anyone in particular, I'll just say that in my opinion, his sources aren't reliable.
So, this morning I call mom, and she says he had invited her and stepdad to an outside bbq, which they attended, doing the best they could to maintain social distancing. In my opinion, that's already an unnecessary risk. But, to top it off, he hadn't told her about his and his family's social indiscretions, and talked her into taking his 3 kids, her grandchildren, home overnight. So, they're there now. 
It's been so difficult to stay away from friends and family through this, but my wife and I, have been doing it. My mom and stepdad have been trying so hard.  I feel like my brother and his reckless, misinformed actions have made it all a waste. I don't know what I'll do if my wonderful parents get needlessly infected. I don't know what I'll say to him.  
Thanks for reading my rant, if you made it. Just needed to get it off my chest. This is a better option than going outside and screaming at the sky. Be safe,  all.","COVID19_support",26,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/ggh746/all_for_nothing/"
"2020-03-25",1585154714,"I had an important realization this morning. (long post, sorry)","I got up pretty early this morning- around 7 AM. I take a medication that must be taken on an empty stomach, so the first half an hour of my morning is usually spent checking social media while waiting for my medication to start working. This morning was no different until I noticed that some birds were chirping outside. This is common. I live in New York where winter could end in March or it could end in May. We're also the epicenter of the outbreak in the US- I live in Buffalo which has marginally fewer cases than NYC does.   
So, I usually don't pay too much attention to the birds (other than sometimes being annoyed because they're loud and wake me up before I'm ready to be awake). However, today I just kind of stopped and listened to the birds chirping. 

And I just listened for a few moments.

And I suddenly felt this sense of peace.

I realized that the birds have no idea what's going on in the world right now. To them, this is just a normal day. Maybe they know something is different, but it's not bothering them at all right now. They still migrated back to the area because it's getting warmer outside now. 

It gave me a huge sense of hope. Winter sometimes lasts longer than we want it to, and sometimes it ends a lot sooner. It can be really unpredictable. If you've never lived in the Great Lakes, especially in Buffalo, we can get some horrible winter storms that close schools, cause power outages, make it impossible to see when driving, and leave us trapped at home. Sometimes they come in with very little warning. Sometimes they even bring thunder and lightning. Some of the damage from these winters is fixable. Some of it is permanent. 

What is certain is that the birds *always* come back when the winter ends. We may not know when exactly that end will come. Sometimes we think it's over, then it comes back with a vengeance. But the birds still return. To me, the sound of birds chirping outside is always a sign that warmer days are coming- that better days are to come. 

Now, the birds can't tell me *when* this pandemic will end. No one really knows that. What it reminded me of was the fact that, like winter, the pandemic *will* eventually end. Just like the birds do at the end of winter, we will eventually return to our normal lives, even if things are much different. We are all feeling some sense of anxiety, fear, maybe even anger or frustration. I wanted to share this because just tuning into something I don't usually think about helped me to realize that in a world where so many things are uncertain, what is certain is that the pandemic and being quarantined are both *not permanent.* 

The birds are still out there doing their thing. Even during a disruption of their usual routine, they still return to living their normal lives. Humans are a lot more complex than birds- I get that- but we, as a species, are capable of rebuilding and returning to normalcy once the worst is over, even if that normalcy is a different from how it used to be. It's going to take time, and that's okay. 

We will adapt.

"2021-03-09",1615250604,"What I'm looking forward to in the future","I cannot WAIT until I can go to a moderately busy coffee shop with my laptop &amp; books, order an oversized coffee, and do work all day while people watching, listening to other people's conversations &amp; just the general buzz of a coffee shop.

Doing work alone at my desk with poor lighting in my stuffy one bedroom apartment has gotten SO OLD, I just hate doing work at this point, I feel so unmotivated.

Following up with that, I cannot WAIT until I can go to a library where I can feel that sense of camaraderie with other students who are also busting their ass studying or doing work, just like me. I miss that non-verbal sense of connection when you make eye contact with someone in a library &amp; it's like you both say ""yeah man, me too"" but with your eyes. It makes me want to work more when I see other people are working, and having done it all alone this past year SUCKS. Watching other people rewatching lectures or writing essays in the library makes me feel like I'm not the only one having to do this shit.

Also, I cannot WAIT until I can have my normal gym routine back. Going to the gym for me used to always be my form of therapy, a place where the focus was just on what I could accomplish that day &amp; just my general well-being &amp; health. It was a place without distractions or other worries &amp; everything was just set up easily for people to use whether it was like the weight rack or machines, etc. Also there was something so meaningful in seeing the same people at your gym consistently because not only would you see each other progress in the gym, but you'd occasionally make eye contact or give each other a nod like ""good lookin, bro, may all the gains be in your favor"" &amp; it's like I miss that so much. Working out at home SUCKS &amp; I miss that general sense of accountability from others that we used to get when we regularly interacted with people.

We are in a COVID-19 hot-spot in a suburb of NYC in Connecticut. My MIL is a classic anti-vaxxer, thinks this is a 5G conspiracy, being blown out of proportion, attempt to attack Trump, etc, etc. Her already unbalanced beliefs and actions have lead to a generally toxic relationship between her, my husband and me and our two toddlers. We have established strong boundaries and know how to stand up to her but she loves to lay on the guilt trip, set herself up as a victim, and pits my husbands brother against him as her defender and peacekeeper, which generally sucks. 

today she has texted the group chat we are all in stating that Easter dinner will be at the usual time next Sunday. Like what?? We said we will be happy to FaceTime in and waited for her response. She immediately shot back- if we are all healthy why is Easter on FaceTime? We didnt respond, though I think we probably need to write one calm one-liner about how we arent attending any gatherings. 

The most frustrating part is that my husbands brother has been allowing her to pick up his 6 month old and babysit him at her house. Im not sure if they are planning to go to her house for Easter or not but if theyre letting her babysit I think they might. There is no legitimate childcare related need to do this as he is not working right now and his wife is working from home so theyre just increasing their risk of infection. My MIL is a cancer survivor so she should not be taking any risks as is. I cant imagine what is possessing them to do this other than she doesnt take the virus seriously and he cant help but try to keep her happy. 

Im so frustrated that during this stressful time of a global crisis, she somehow finds a way to make this all about her and how enlightened she is and how we are sheep listening to the government. We are need to make sacrifices for the common good. This situation really has the potential to bring out the best and worst in people. I wish I could go off on her but she knows the guidelines and statistics and either thinks they are lies or dont apply to her. Also, her birthday is in two days so shes going to guilt us about this too. Im so grateful my husband and I are on the same team and support each other in dealing with her and keeping her at a distance because this type of toxic relationship is so stressful and can be damaging. 

As much as I know she is unhinged and manipulative, I cant help but get a little heated, which is why Im posting here.

Our team is working from 8:30am to 9-10pm every single day due to the overwhelming increase in workload the past 2 months and none of us are getting overtime pay. Our boss has been delaying salary adjustments since December, telling us it would be pushed back to August since we had a slow Q4. Well, after Covid-19 hit, its been delayed again indefinitely and we have not gotten any updates from upper management. I'm pretty sure our entire team's moral is at an all time low.

We are too busy to even train a temp employee at this point. And i just want to quit. Obviously its a stupid move financially but my mental health is completely in shambles being overworked to the bone. However, every time i think about quitting, i have this internal dialog on why i should stay, that i should be grateful to even have a job and a paycheck. I have had this dialog in my head probably over a dozen+ times the past 6 months, but every time im about to quit, I manage to guilt trip myself into staying.

 I just want to pull out my emergency savings and live off that for a year  and focus on my own projects, goals, and mental health.

We closed up pretty early, 11th of March the universities and schools and by the 13th everything except grocery stores and pharmacies was closed. We only had one case in my city at the time.

I sat through terrible anxiety and depression in lockdown since, for almost three months, locked inside my home, not seeing my friends, my brother or my grandmothers. I followed every rule. I never left the house without a mask even for a walk away from people. I have been cleaning floors and products daily (my mom has to go grocery shopping). We had a police enforced curfew since closing, no one allowed to leave their homes after 4pm until the next morning, old people could only from 8 am - 12 pm and young people from 12 pm - 4 pm so they won't mingle. On weekends we couldn't leave at all or face fines/jail time. During Orthodox Easter, our biggest religious holiday, we were locked in for 85 hours and not allowed to leave our houses. We went through all of that.

And suddenly they re-opened everything this week. Cafes, restaurants, malls, city transport, everything. There are still some rules and measures but it's open. No more lockdown. No more quarantine. People are on the streets in masses. And the number of infected is growing rapidly.

We have had 2077 confirmed cases, 121 deaths (which is a lot based on our population) and 470 active cases. About 230 of those are in my city of 600.000 population.

This morning I get a call from my mom, who tells me that one of her staff tested positive for Covid, and she sent home another bartender who was in close contact as well. She wanted me to come in tonight to lend a hand since shes nervous shes going to be short staffed.

Im 25. I have a full time job and work from home. Ive gone to maybe two restaurants when my home state was among the lowest case per capita in the nation. Other than that, its been social distance hangs and Take-out only. I wear masks everywhere I go, even just walking down the street.

She desperately wanted me to come home from Texas when it was spiking, fearing my safety. So, I ended my lease and went back to my home state to live with her. Now, she wants me to come work at her restaurant.

These questions included:
- Who else was the staff member exposed to? (Apparently just a bartender and...no one else?)

- Are you closing down at LEAST the area she was working in?

The company provided people with masks who don't have one to use; others bring masks from home. Most people wear the company-provided mask, which is a thin, single-layer, loose-fitting mask (basically no protection whatsoever). Many wear them improperly. 

The thermometers aren't accurate at all. I walk 5 blocks to work from my house, and the forehead theromometers (I used three because I didn't think they were accurate) read 94 degrees. If someone did come in with a fever, the thermometers wouldn't detect it. Hopefully they'd feel physically sick enough to not bother coming in, or to at least go to the nurse. 

Social distancing is a complete fail. I'm on an assembly line and pretty much nobody even tries to give each other space. I can reach out and touch one or two people (or more) most places I stand. 

Even though break rooms and bathrooms get cleaned and sanitized, the main floors where we work do not. Dirty surfaces, tools, etc. 

Our facility is ventilated-- we have two large vents that circulate air from outside, plus there's smaller fans everywhere. So basically any potential virus is blown everywhere! 

Of the 1400+ workers at my factory, 4 or 5 have gotten Covid since the beginning of the year. So far, nobody in my department has gotten sick. But if someone does, a lot of others probably will too. 

Both my parents, whom I still live with, have health issues, and are in their 50s. My dad and my brother also work in the same factory, but in different departments where social distancing is much easier than in my department. I'd be most likely to get infected and bring home the virus to my family. Oh, and my house makes it impossible to self-isolate, so if I get sick, we all get sick. 

I've had a lot of anxiety surrounding Covid before starting work, and now that I've started, I'm feeling hopeless. I need the money, and few places in town pay as well. I currently don't have a car and can't drive myself to a different job so that others in my family can drive to their jobs, so having the factory walking distance from my house is convenient (though I still plan to save up for one). I feel like I'm in a really bad situation and I can't really do much of anything to improve it. 

I really want to avoid this awful virus, mostly for my parents' sakes. I'm more likely to be mostly okay if I get it (though I'm still scared of it) than they are. There are times when I'm by myself that I just can't handle my fears and I just cry. I'm trapped and there's no way out other than being broke and living off my parents, which I don't want to do.","COVID19_support",20,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hepmc8/my_jobs_precautions_are_a_total_joke/"
"2020-10-08",1602123152,"I am COVID-19 positive, and my in-laws refuse to quarantine","I am stuck in self isolation at my in-laws house because a family member tested positive while we were here. I am now COVID-19 positive. I am far away from my home and my comfort zone, so far that return is not feasible (7+ hour drive and mostly rural). I did not feel good about coming down here because I know that at least two of his siblings work high risk jobs. 

Now I have tested positive, and my husband is negative but displaying mild symptoms, so presumptive positive. My MIL and FIL were exposed to us after we were exposed to the positive family member, but before said family member tested positive, so we had to stay here and monitor symptoms - but they have refused to stay home as long as they werent feeling sick. Now they are refusing to quarantine even though they work a business that is people-facing, even though I have tested positive and they have had contact with me, and Im staying, you know, in their house. My MIL even expressed that she does not believe my COVID test result is real. 

They are upset with my husband when he wears a mask when he has to leave our room to go to the bathroom. When I go to the bathroom with mine they look at me funny or not at all. This is so confusing to me, because they have always struck me as kind people. Stubborn, but kind. Now there is a legitimate concern and they are acting like Im delusional.

They say they dont care if they get COVID, but *I* care if they get COVID. They forget that they are at higher risk than average, because they are both around 60 and one of some sort of lung malformation. They say we are living our lives in fear. They will not wear masks in the house themselves because they claim they cannot breathe with them on. We are wearing ours outside of the room, and they dont like it, but will be doing so whether they like it or not. We are also lysoling every surface we touch in the bathroom after we go. 

MIL yelled at my husband tonight because he gently asked if they were going to get tested and told them that the doctor said they needed to quarantine, too. He is a very gentle person, rarely ever raises his voice. He has not had a single conflict with them in his life. Ever. He is the peacemaker in his family, a little bit of a Mommas boy, but with an excellent head on his shoulders. Hes been carrying a lot of my weight this week emotionally, because I have panic disorder and recently came out of a very rough flare of chronic illness. Ive had panic attacks daily this week, cried to him, cried at him, cried at the wall...Hes been my rock and taken care of me at my worst moments. Ive not been in the best headspace and hes helped me a lot.

He initially wanted to take this trip to relax and spend time with his family before we went alone to a cabin to celebrate a special milestone. Even if I wasnt fully onboard with seeing every member of his family right now, I wanted him happy, and thought that a getaway in a rural cabin would be socially distant enough. But, it only takes one asymptomatic encounter to spread, and we let our guard down. I can tell hes down, in a way he rarely gets. Physically he says he feels fine, but I know he needs emotional support, too.

And I, as someone with mental illness, need some positivity to get through this. My in-laws wont kick us out, but I am worried about maintaining a positive outlook and keeping others safe while staying here. And we literally have nowhere else to go that wouldnt involve a drive spanning hundreds of miles.","COVID19_support",9,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/j74ins/i_am_covid19_positive_and_my_inlaws_refuse_to/"

That makes it all the more frustrating to see people that I consider friends being so irresponsible with it.

Honestly, I feel like I'm going crazy every time I go on social media and see people my age breaking quarantine. It feels like it's everyone. I get that we're all lonely, but partying every weekend in the middle of a pandemic is absurd. Now I struggle to connect with old friends without getting frustrated with their selfish outlook on the pandemic. I'd love to make new friends but the circumstances make it pretty impossible to meet people so now I just feel more isolated than ever.

Whenever you are out in public, other people dont respect personal distance and walk right up to you without even asking. My father (hes high risk from his health issues) and I have been social distancing from others and staying home where we feel safe. The only time he goes out is to do curb side at the grocery or our favorite pizza place. The last I heard from work they werent going to be open to the public and just do curb side services. Then, out of the blue, last week they announced that we are open. I get another email and it says due to the concern of legal action that they arent going to require the public to wear masks. The higher up staff will be safely behind plexiglass barriers, but not people in my position. I dont feel safe to go back to work. My counselor said it is normal and okay for me to be too scared to go back to work in a public place during a pandemic. She is looking into extending my unemployment. She said they have unemployment set aside for this reason. She told me she was going to get my documentation of my mental health disability (generalized anxiety disorder) ready in case the state asks for me. This was on Wednesday and I havent heard back.

I love my family. We are a fairly cohesive unit (given everyone's developmental stages in life). I need space. We live in a 1000 sq ft mobile home with an indoor dog, an outdoor dog, and we just got 3 2 week old chickens. We just got a land survey and are working with an architect to build our forever home. My mom usually picks the kids up from school, and we have dinner with my parents about once a week. All of this has been put on hold. 

I am a fairly outgoing person. I feel so isolated and stressed. My little one is melting down twice a day (like laying on the floor kicking and screaming for 15+ minutes), my teenager regularly goes into rage mode when asked to complete a chore, and my husband has little to no patience for those things on a regular non-COVID day. I feel like I am handeling everyone's emotions and schedules and I. just. can't. anymore.

I just had a complete breakdown bawling painful chest caving crying over a damn spider (granted I am on my period, and am in need of a hysterectomy, but that's a whole other can of worms). 

I know this will pass. I know almost everyone is struggling right now. I just need a damn break. I can't keep my privilege in check right now because my brain is in crisis mode. I hate that about me right now, but I don't know how to fix it. This is such a unique and seemingly unfixable situation. 

My parents are both in 'vulnerable' health and age groups. I don't want to put them at risk by keeping the kids for a bit, even though my mom has offered. My cousin is our other usual babysitter, but she is also in the 'vulnerable' health category. I don't know what else to do. We have taken two 'dates' to run out and pick up food, leaving the kids at home. I hesitate to do this very often because they kids don't always get along and I worry that their usual screaming and crying and slamming doors may escalate when we are not home. The teenager has been in trouble in the past for betting violent with others. He's a good kid, just has a bad temper and is still in the 'act-before-you-think' stage of life.

I don't really know how to deal with that loss, both because I love them dearly (they are the best parents a son could've ever asked for) and also because I will be alone in this world after that.  Due to their heightened risk, and my ability to work from home, the three of us essentially went into a soft lockdown over the last two years to avoid them getting sick, and never came out of it.  As a result, I have over time lost all other relationships with family and friends.  Now, with the virus being utterly unavoidable, they will die and I will be left alone.

If we want something to clean our workspace with that will actually kill the virus we have to bring it from home.   I've even heard from flight attendants at other airlines that they have run out of gloves while working.   I've heard so many horror stories about people being penalized for calling in unless they can get a positive test, people finding out through the grapevine that they were exposed and being told to still come into work unless they develop symptoms, even a story of a pilot who tested positive being allowed to fly home.

I'm scared as hell at work. It's not a big house, and I work with 1 person at a time with 4 residents. However, while I'm not cross trained at other houses, many employees are. So they rotate around 2-3 group homes within the company. The company has about 250 people, and so far 2 have tested positive from a different location within the company and anyone who was around them is quarantining/getting tested. 

The job has good benefits and decent pay. Im full time and it still works with being a part time student. The company is pretty okay. But because it's hard to social distance in that small-ish house, I really worry about exposure. Obviously we have to eat on the job so we take masks off, and theres no separate area to go eat in like a break room just a small staff office. 

I'm 25 F, overweight but losing weight and eat healthy, take my vitamins/vitamin D. My boyfriend is one of the only people I see and he has asthma. He works as a cook at a restaurant but might soon quit as he wants to go to school full time.

My SO's friend is coming to visit this weekend and will be staying overnight. My partner and I are both vaccinated but the friend (we'll call her Stacey) is unvaccinated.  
She just doesn't want it and that's fine - Stacey is still my SO's friend and they haven't gotten to see each other in a long time. When I asked my own friends if they wanted to hang out with us this weekend, they all came up with very polite but also very obviously fabricated excuses - except one pal who just outright told me she wasn't comfortable being in the same room as an unvaccinated person, which I totally understood.

I also feel guilty for having an unvaccinated person stay in general so I'm going to put myself in a mini quarantine for 2 weeks - so basically work from home, get our groceries delivered and not hang out with people again - until the weekend of October 9th. I just would feel selfish and a bit thoughtless doing otherwise because I know a lot of people would be uneasy with it (including my own friend group).

Going forward though - I can't help but be worried about the fact that my SO has one or two other friends who are unvaccinated and I don't really want this scenario to keep popping up over and over again.

In your opinion - would it be unreasonable or self-centred of me to ask my SO that only vaccinated people visit our home from now on? As with everything with Covid-19, this is unchartered territory and I just don't know if it would come across as controlling or unrealistic for me to ask for this.

Also - while I personally put my full trust in the vaccine, I don't think it's my place to put pressure on anyone else to get it.

And I actually don't know how to cope. Just a few weeks ago I broke up with my boyfriend because he was psychologically abusive, he hit on another woman and lied to me hundreds of times during the course of 2 years, but also kept lying almost in a pathological way when I confronted him, even regarding obvious things.

Immediately goes to IMC (intermediate care, one step blow ICU) is put on a BiPAP and alternating to the high flow oxygen machine. He fluctuates between 84-88% blood oxygen levels all week with some good days where he could eat and generally good spirits and some bad days. He refused to be intubated and to be put on a ventilator even though the ICU recommended it. I tried to tell him even though it's scary it is the best thing for him to get better and to trust the doctors. Finally, last night I get an urgent call. I could tell from the nurse's voice it wasn't good news. Despite having a good morning where he said he felt fine, that night his blood oxygen levels plummeted and with his agreement, they had no choice but to intubate him. I pulled over on the side of the road so I could speak to my dad to tell him how much I loved him, that he is my hero and he is going to pull through. He told me he loved me and he was so proud of me.

Today is day one of being on a ventilator in the ICU. He is still very sick and his lungs are in rough shape. His blood oxygen levels are between 92% and 94% which is good considering. The Doctors have all told me he has a chance, not much of one but a chance. He is in his early 50s, never smoked, barely drinks, never really been sick but he is overweight (300lb at 6'2). I was hoping for good news or at least no news for a few days at least but I talked to the nurse this evening and there is a concern for his kidneys and that the doctor will call me later to discuss. That is never a good sign I think.

My mother, once seeing my dad get rushed out decided (after we begged her) to admit herself as well. It was probably the best thing she ever did. She is still in the IMC but her lungs are healing. She is on the high flow nasal mask and fluctuating between 92% and 94% blood oxygen levels. She was able to get up today and walk a bit as well as eat regular meals and shower. The nurses and doctors have been very pleased with her progress. I am so happy with her progress even if it's at a slow pace.

I never thought this would happen to my family. I never thought I'd be part of a support group but here I am. It's hard. Really hard. I believe in my parents very much to get through this nasty disease even if the statistics and the odds are hard to swallow. My only solace is that my parents are in the care of a fantastic medical team. I have an incredible girlfriend who has been supporting me the whole time and a job that has been overwhelmingly understanding of the situation I am in.

So here I am. I have a composition book full of room numbers, nurses' numbers, questions, updates. I have been taking notes on what medications have been administered, what hasn't been administered. Also keeping track of my parent's bills, insurance info, updating their jobs on their progress as well. I'm trying to do my part so they can do theirs and recover. I am not religious but have been praying every day. I'm trying to stay positive but it is difficult when you get nothing but bad news. I'd give anything to hug my parents again.

If you made it this far thank you for reading my story and thank you for giving me a chance to get this off my chest. I wish you all and your family good health.

UPDATE 12/30/21: 
Spoke with the ICU last night. There was a concern for my dad's kidneys as they took a big hit from being so sick and showing some signs of damage. There wasn't any evidence of kidney failure but they wanted to get ahead of it just in case. I told him if he needs a kidney I have an extra one and everyone else in my family said the same thing. The doctor told me at this time a kidney transplant would be very dangerous and my father in his condition wouldn't survive the procedure. So with that, he said they will be trying some different things and we'll see where we are in the morning. 
I woke up this morning in my parent's house. I moved in yesterday with my brother from the hotel I have been staying at near the hospital. It was eerily quiet. Usually, at this time of the morning at my parent's house I wake up to the sound of my dad making coffee and the sound of the TV downstairs. I told myself it was going to be a good day. Made some of my own coffee, smoked a cigarette, and sat down at my dad's computer to start making some phone calls to the hospital. I mentally prepared myself for what I was going to hear. 
Thankfully, the nurse told me his kidneys are doing much better today. It's been a while since I've heard ""doing much better"" from any nurse or doctor so that was reassuring. But of course, there is concern now his oxygen levels have dropped a bit since yesterday so they are working through that today. At this point, I will take any decent news I can get. 
My mom is still in a good spot, about the same as yesterday but her chest x-ray is looking a little clearer. Fantastic. I asked the nurse to please keep pushing her, keep working with her, I need my mom right now.

I'm mad because of the increasing  number of Covid-19 cases here at Mexico (today the number is up to 14677 confirmed cases,  including 1351 death's. And I have seen a lot of people  complaining on internet in both ways, some that is fake,  is a scheme to ""slave us"" and the government control us... but also people that complaints that the government is NOT testing enough, the numbers are faked to be ""too low"".

However, something else is added: it's clear that there is a political fight involved too. If the numbers are right, my home state, despite having the second or third most populous city in the whole nation, the numbers of confirmed and death  are pretty low, even compared to other less populous states (282 confirmed cases, 25 deaths here at Jalisco). God, we are even on the last 3 places on number of cases per 100,000 people,  that should be something to notice... but nope, Federal government is ignoring and still accusing that we are not doing enough...
Hell, here the state ordered to everyone use masks from the Monday in public places, there's a lot of problems since a lot of business are closed to help slow the disease,  I even had to go home with half salary since our workplace must have massive events to work, and we are ""offline"" since late March, following states orders an so.

What I'm angry,  is that we started to make sacrifices, a lot. Yes, a lot of people isn't helping,  even some idiots dare to assault healthcare workers. But also a lot is making everything possible so we can survive this. Dammit, even the local churches switched to make all the celebrations,  including holy week, via live streams on internet so people don't need to go physically to the temples. Schools started home education earlier than other places, massive events cancelled,  bars closed... the response  of our state was early,  even other states followed us and joined the efforts with the same actions... but the federal government still dismiss us, telling that we are doing wrong...

Funny thing: tomorrow the federal government is issuing the orders to wear masks in public, we already had been a week there... and unfortunately,  the main issue I see, is that what happens  on Ciudad despite Mexico,  can affect tottaly other states,  caused by the fact the nation is heavily centralized...

I work for a call center I.T. company. We do IT remotely for over 500 companies in the State of NJ where the COVID-19 numbers have been one of the highest in the country.

During Phase 1 (from March through May), we had a perfect work from home infrastructure and our technicians thrived. Our ticket counts were the lowest they have been in years, all while working from home. All our clients were paying us and our owner still qualified for government assistance for over $5 Million that I'm pretty sure he doesn't have to repay. We are NOT hurting financially at all.

In New Jersey, Phases 1, 2 &amp; 3 all require that office workers work from home if at all possible. While still in phase 1, my employer started to mandate that all employees come in the office (even though we had a perfect work from home infrastructure in place).

This wasn't quite what bothered me though. What really bothered me was the fact that when you got to the office, there wasn't any safety precautions put into effect. All the employees were walking around without masks. Anyone that didn't have a mask was called out by our bosses and made to look childish and incompetent. They attacked us mentally and made snarky remarks in front of all our co-workers. They essentially demean you until you give up and remove your mask. They also called large meetings into a small conference room where employees were forced to stand shoulder to shoulder without any PPE.

I've worked here for over 5 years and I'm yet to experience this type of toxic work environment up until this point. It almost feels as if they are trying to push their political agenda on you.

I'm not sure what to do. They are still in fact paying the bills, but at what cost? Should I just shut-up and color, or should I stand my ground? If I choose the latter, what are my options?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm quite lost right now and mentally exhausted over this matter. Also, my owner does NOT believe in a HR department for a company with over 100 employees, so we do not have one.","COVID19_support",19,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hfmmr3/employer_singling_out_employees_that_wear_a_mask/"
"2020-04-04",1585962433,"Grandma and Grandpa passed away from Covid-19. Feeling anxious and helpless.","TLDR: Grandpa and Grandma have passed from Covid-19. My SO is in a country that refuses to quarantine. 

I typed out my post earlier this morning you can see it below this paragraph. Im too tired to change it. But since this afternoon my grandpa has also passed. My mom has been sobbing throughout the afternoon and shes feeling terrified. This whole situation is surreal. From dealing with planning a virtual funeral to seeing my grandpas body through video feed, its just unbelievable. Earlier I was feeling powerless and now Im just horrified. 

TLDR: My grandma passed away from Covid-19. We are holding a virtual funeral due to quarantine. And my SO has asthma and Im not coping well. 

My grandparents have never been very close to me/my family. My mom has been estranged from them for the past 4 years. They live in New York and recently contracted Covid-19. We were contacted by my cousin and luckily my mom was able to contact my grandma when she could still talk. My grandparents are/were in their 70s/80s and grandma wasnt as healthy as my grandpa. Grandpa is still hanging in there but recently my grandma passed away and everything is surreal. Normally we could drive to NYC to help out and handle things. But with the spread of Covid-19 and the state of NYC we cant go there. My mom couldnt see grandma in the hospital and cant see her now that shes passed. My mom has been calling to set up the funeral but we cannot attend in person. And to add to this surreal feeling the funeral will be live streamed to us and other family members. 

Now that the disease in closer than ever to my family Im feeling terribly anxious. My SO is in another country that isnt taking the proper precautions to prevent the virus from spreading. He has to go to work everyday and soon he will be transferred to a rural area right outside of a huge city. He has asthma and Im petrified. We talk everyday and the thought of the virus just looms in the background of our conversations. We bring it up every once and awhile but the both of us just get silent. Its terrifying to acknowledge how dangerous Covid-19 is. I feel so powerless and anxious.

Edit: So the virtual funeral was held yesterday. It was as surreal and absurd as we thought it would be. The funeral directors were wearing masks while placing the caskets in the grave. We said last words through a phone conference call. There was no pastor and everything was rushed. The funeral home was so busy they never even processed the second payment for my Grandpa. 

Two days ago we found out where they likely contracted the virus. They had been mostly isolated, and for necessities their carer would buy groceries and leave everything at their door. But despite this effort they still chose to attend church weekly. A few other attending members had contracted covid-19 as well (We had called their family doctor who gave us this information). So this is likely where they got it from. Please urge your loved ones to stay away from large gatherings and keep isolated at home. 

Some happier news, my SO is doing well and  his company has put in new protocols to keep everyone social distancing from one another. The company did this on their own, without and pressure from the government. I feel more at ease.

Also Im not sure if anyone will see this but shoutout to NYC heath workers, customer service workers, and funeral home workers. You guys were really amazing. There was never a hurtful or cold word said. Despite the situation everyone was unbelievably kind. The nurse in charge of my grandparents tried to accommodate my mom as well as she could despite the danger. The hospital workers who transferred our calls were always so sweet and had said condolences when they heard the news. The man at the security/lost in found counter was so patient and informative as well as kind when we were trying to figure out where my deceased grandparents stuff was. Really thank you for everything you have done.","COVID19_support",17,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fukixv/grandma_and_grandpa_passed_away_from_covid19/"

I am going to go and play some PS4 on my first day away from work. Fallout 4 sounds appropriate enough. Still contemplating whether or not I made the right decision of going on a temporary leave of absence. But I think 18 months is a worse case scenario because of how many unknowns there are. It's not going to be economically realistic to remain in lockdown for 18 months imo.

But we will still get through this. I have a sister who lives and teaches in Moscow, she is now at home and has moved all courses to be online for the next 6 weeks. Russia is a country that lost 27 million its own citizens fighting a far more evil and cruel force than the coronavirus. If we as a species went through WWII and survived and civilization didn't collapse, why would we assume the same for a pandemic.

"2020-05-11",1589213325,"Best friend chooses to take a risk with someones life. Friendship ender or am I overreacting?","Ill start at the beginning. About a month ago, my best friend (lets call him Thomas) tells me he thinks his wife has Covid-19. Shes exhibited two of the major symptoms of the virus - sustained shortness of breath and a fever for multiple days in a row. The shortness of breath was so bad she could barely utter a word. I agreed she most likely had Covid-19 based on the symptoms. (She has no prior history of asthma, or anything which could have been a previous symptom of shortness of breath). I said his wife should stay isolated in a separate room in the house, with no contact from the otherwise healthy family members. Thomas has three children, so he was taking care of the kids, doing all the housework, schooling, working from home and taking care of his wife, cleaning, sanitizing, plus making all the food, etc& Definitely a lot to handle for one person considering we have to shelter in place, but its what had to be done.

They called her doctor to let them know about what was going on and were advised to stay home unless it became more serious. This is what they did, except for one outing she did by herself. She wanted to get a test to see if it was Covid-19 and made an appointment on Day 3. She drove down to the testing center, only to be turned away after additional screening because she hadnt had contact with anyone who had tested positive. At least not that she knew of anyway. She drove home to continue her self-isolation. Her symptoms continued for a total of five days before starting to get better. Her breathing became much better and the fever subsided. I was happy for her, that she was feeling better, but not out of the woods by any means.

In the middle of this, two days into his wifes symptoms becoming better, Thomas told me he was going to leave the house to meet a client. I was quite shocked by this. I explained your wife is presumed to have Covid-19 and its only been a couple days. You have a moral obligation to stay home and isolate for at least two weeks. He said work was light and he was worried about not being able to provide for his family. (His family is not near running out of money by any means.) I said there are bigger issues at stake here. His wife most likely has it and he could be asymptomatic. Its not a chance to take lightly, especially with someone else life. He could unknowingly infect his client, as well as their family. He started crying on the phone, caught between a rock and a hard place. He said he was going to take every precaution, stay six feet away, wear a mask and gloves. I told him there was no guarantee he could be 100% safe. Since his wife was presumed positive, he should isolate as well. He didnt want to hear anymore about it, so we had to end the conversation.

We didnt speak again until two weeks after his client meeting. I couldnt bring myself to even speak to him during that time. I view this as a moral issue, potentially putting someones life at risk and possibly killing them or causing them health issues. When we finally did speak on the phone, we got into it heavy and hard. It was the worst conversation we have ever had. Words were said and no side budged. He saw this as me not trusting his judgement, not supporting his best friend. I saw this as a moral issue with potential life changing decisions. I mean, I never ever expected this kind of behavior from him. After things got heated, we hung up. We went back and forth via text for the few days. He ended up wanting to get the last word (after continuing to try and get me to agree he did the right thing), and then said lets agree to disagree. Not the outcome I really wanted.

Am I wrong to be thinking this way? Am I being too hard on him? Should I have been more understanding or trusting? Im not sure I can, or want to, move past this. This is supposedly my best friend. I hold him to a much higher standard than other people. Hell, I think its a basic standard I would hold anyone to. Lets keep each other safe. I never thought in a million years Id be debating with him why its important to not take risks/chances with someone else life. That you cant be 100% certain of safety. Is this, or should this be, a dealbreaker? He was my best friend, Im just not to certain I know who this person is anymore.

(As a follow up, the wife did get the antibody test and it came out negative. (Of course it could be a false result, or he could be lying to me.) He also said his client was healthy.

All my favorite parts of teaching are just gone. I don't get to see or really even interact with my 2nd graders, I'm not teaching meaningful lessons because it's all being compressed into 10 min videos, there's no discussion, I don't get to be in my classroom with students or experience read-alouds with them. Now it's just sitting in front of a computer delivering content to a screen.

I'm also having trouble managing working from home and being productive. There's a reason I don't have a desk job... I hate sitting in front of a computer all day and the increase in emails, parent contact, and desk work rather than hands-on teaching is so hard to manage. I live in a one bedroom apartment with my boyfriend and he's working from home too so we both don't have enough space, plus I'm awkwardly recording lesson videos into my computer which makes it hard for him to work. My constant anxiety about this whole situation in the world is making it really hard for me to motivate myself.

My district is making us ""take attendance"" and put number grades on the submitted work of 2nd graders, and I have some kids who haven't logged on at all or don't have access to devices or internet. How are they possibly going to learn? To top it all off, this is my first year teaching. I started in January and it was hard enough as a new teacher but to transition to all of this and learning all the online programs and having to try to help support parents when I don't know what to do myself... it's so incredibly overwhelming.

It started out 2 years ago with a ""Once cases go down then things will go back to normal"" then it went to ""Once the vaccine is available, things will go back to normal."" then it was ""Once we get the second shot, things will go back to normal."" then things got really bad and it became ""Well, once the kids can get vaccinated things will go back to normal"" and then my 5 year old got vaccinated and now it's ""Well, once the 6m to 5 year vaccine drops, things will go back to normal.""

I grew up living in the country. Going to grandma's house and playing outside with my friends till it got dark. Getting dirty and having fun. I've always been an EXTREMELY social person. I had a wonderful upbringing with tons of extended family and friends throughout my childhood and into adulthood.

The first year of the pandemic was hard. My wife is very cautious and we don't go anywhere. We haven't been on a date in over 2 years. We haven't had alone time outside the house in I don't even know how long. I haven't hung out with my friends, Went to the movies, been to a basketball game, or anything social.

It breaks my heart that I don't see my family but it breaks my heart even more that my children are being deprived of growing up around family. It absolutely kills me.

It breaks my heart that my children don't play with other children. My wife isn't comfortable with it. Whether their parents are vaccinated or not. Whether my family is vaccinated or not.

It is truly causing me both physical and mental anguish. I've developed stress related physical illnesses in the form of chronic pain, Head pressure, Neck stiffness, ringing in my ears, muscle spasms in my throat (Feeling of wanting to cry), and more...

Mentally I'm a fucking train wreck.  I have never been in such despair mentally. If I'm not sad, I'm mad. I'm constantly taking deep breaths and trying desperately to control my stress. I've been to the doctor and they say there is nothing that can be done. They've done X-Rays, scans, Anti-depressants, Anti-inflammatories, and more. NOTHING works and scans came back clean.

I've never in my life been the type of person that takes medications or had any sort of mental or real physical health issues. But, now... I can't sleep well. I constantly 100% of the time hear a ringing in my both of my ears. I feel broken both physically and mentally.

I saw a light at the end of the tunnel when they announced that the 6month to 5 year vaccine could be released in March. Then it got delayed and now there is no date and we have to wait another month after the 2 year old gets the vaccine anyway...

My family... they understand. They don't agree with the incredibly strict and socially locked down rules we live by in our family. They worry about the kids and about me and to be honest I don't blame them. ALL of my friends are taking their kids out on play dates. Out to the movies. Out to eat dinner as a family. Out to family reunions. Out to be normal human beings. They always ask why my kids can't come over. Why I can't come out with them. The kids ask me ""Why can't we go see grandma?""

we go to the park on Sundays and we have to drive around and look for empty parks. I know when we drive past a big fun park and there are a kids playing that my 5 year old wants to play with them and it completely fucking destroys me on the inside.

I don't know what I'm looking for by typing all of this out. I am just so desperate. It's literally killing me. I have never felt so fucking awful in my life. I went from being the happiest and proudest new father in the world to being broken and beaten down by sadness, stress, and anxiety within 2 years.

She was perfectly health before this and suffered for a month and a half in the hospital. My husbands maternal grandfather also passed away from COVID, 2 days after my MIL. And, one of my great uncles passed away from COVID, even though he was vaccinated (he had other major health issues). As you can tell, COVID has had a HUGE impact on my husband and I. 

My husband and I are expecting our first child in a few months. We live in MA where the rise in cases have been ridiculous lately. Hes 100% work from home and as of recently, I only go into the office one day a week (with a very limited staff). We havent been going out to eat or spent more time than absolutely necessary at stores. Were doubled vaxxed and boosted. My health and the babys health are our main concerns right now. 

Weve made a rule that anyone who wants to come to my baby shower or see the baby when he or she is born, will need to be vaccinated. And anyone flying in from out of town will also need to test. We are firm on this and initially we didnt think itd be an issue because 99.9% of everyone we know and care about is vaccinated. With the exception of my SIL who lives in TX. She says she had COVID back when their mom had it so she has natural immunity. She says shes not an anti-vaxxer, she just doesnt see the point of getting it herself. My husband has given her the facts and medical studies to explain why its important but shes dragging her feet. Last night, she told my husband that she might have gotten COVID again and it didnt affect her really so shes going to continue to wait on getting it. My husband was upset but he simply reiterated our rules for seeing the baby and asked how long shes going to wait. She said shes not sure and she would have preferred this to completely be her decision, insinuating that were holding the baby above her head. He explained if shes going to wait, thats her choice and she can see the baby when theyre 6 months (a COVID vaccine for 6 months to 5 years old is coming out next month). There was a brief moment last night when my husband felt bad and wondered if should just let her come over with a mask but I think we need to be firm, even though its a shitty situation.

Rundown: Im 23F, bad asthma and bad allergies. Double vaxxed since late April this year. Booster was scheduled& but cancelled because I was around someone who had covid.

Timeline of how I was exposed: Last Saturday, my antimask antivax coworker came in with a fever and didnt tell anyone. A couple days later on Tuesday, my other coworker (vaccinated with J&amp;J) who I work most closely too went home early feeling sick. They had an at home test& and testing positive. I got my hands on an at home test, and was negative. Thursday got a proper PCR, got results back Mon(yesterday) and it was negative. This Saturday (Christmas) I woke up with a sore throat and body aches. Today (Tuesday) I got a local rapid test, which was positive.

Timeline of symptoms: 
Sat: woke up with a headache and sore throat. Throat was bad enough I couldnt sleep. Off and on body aches and lethargy.
Sun: sore throat gone, now I have a cough. 
Mon: cough more annoying but more productive, coughing lots of mucus, some chest pain and heaviness.
Tues (today): can breathe a little more clear. Off and on headache. Still a cough but its dying down. Ribs sore from coughing.
Never had a fever and was pretty convinced I just had a cold, I probably wouldnt have even thought it was covid if I wasnt exposed TWICE in a row. My family keeps checking in on me and I keep reassuring them& Im okay and Im truly just not all that sick lol. The weirdest thing to it(and why I got another test) was I just was not getting much better every day.

I didnt see my family on Christmas, but it was for the best. I kept saying I wasnt sick enough for it to be covid, but I was wrong. And now because of my one selfish coworker, my other coworker, her partner, her mom, myself, and my partner (well negative for now, but starting to get sick) all have covid.

Ive been nagging them to get the vaccine from day 1 but they wouldnt. Today my mom called to tell me my grandma is in the hospital on oxygen since Friday. I said so she has covid and she said no, cystic fibrosis and pneumonia from having radiation for breast cancer years ago. She swore up and down she had a negative covid test. I ask to see the paperwork and it said September 2nd admitted.. then my mom cracked and said my grandma didnt want me to know but she had covid in September and was in the hospital for a month and then discharged to the home with 3 oxygen tanks and then went back this Friday.. I got mad because I knew this would happen and my mom snapped and said Ive been going through stuff too and proceeded to say she was sick from august 19 for three weeks with a fever and now has blood clots in her legs and lungs so bad she cant walk and protein in her urine from her blood thinners.. I said oh so you had covid first and she said no I had a negative test& but she waited to be rested after 3 weeks so of course she tested negative and my grandma positive. I asked if she regrets not getting the vaccine and she sakd the vaccine could have given her blood clots and killed her. I talked to my grandmas nurse and she said she wasnt understand how serious this is and went home against medical advice during that one period. My mom apparently thought she was stable and actually discharged. I told my mom I directly asked the nurse what the fibrosis was from and she said covid not breast cancer although that could have exacerbated it.. so yeah Im hurt and mad. It doesnt feel real. Im posting this for 1) support as I dont know many people who have went through this actually and 2) for information on her prognosis becayse they couldnt say.. I know my mom said my grandma said she wouldnt take a vent but considering shes on high oxygen Im assuming they probably offered it to her but maybe not. We need to try to get off work and get our dogs in boarding but if I wait until Friday idk if she will make it.. shes alert and conscious just on medication, oxygen and anti anxiety meds.

The situation I am in while I'm typing this is making my skin crawl. I had a doctor's appointment this morning and on the way back my younger sister asked me to pick her up from work. So I did so and now we are just hanging out, but she is sitting on my bed and it is making me want to strip the entire thing and wash all my sheets because she was in public prior to this.

2. She's vaccinated
3. Fomites aren't how Covid or its strains transfer

I have not brushed my teeth since February. I know that discontinuing taking precautions would result in me being happy again. But my fear of long covid is preventing me from doing so.

I had a ""just do it"" mentallity and was able to filter out all the noise in news and just pay attention to the facts and look at the bigger picture to get a guage on how the pandemic was going around the world and my city. I was able to multitask so well that i even got promoted. I've even been able to teach my kid so many good things and have been pretty good at entertaining her. And i've never complained because i knew in the end all of the work i've been doing will be worth it.

But for the past few weeks its been extremely hard because i think my kid is no longer young enough to NOT notice things (i.e. she notices EVERYTHING), and now has the new found ability to actually form opinions and describe things. In other words, she is no longer satisfied with staying at home. Which translates into some kind of frustration and anger. Not only that, at the same time my work has been very very very busy and requires my expertise from 8-7 every day, so i can't even give her an ounce of attention sometimes. And she knows that, which means she gets even more frustrated.

In other words, she's now old enough to experience all the mental trauma that older kids have been experiencing being isolated.

Yesterday, during her giant tantrums (didn't want to sleep even though she's dead tired from refusing to nap or even sleep at night after 4 hours, every day, even if i fed her well), I yelled at her in my most violent way (i didn't hit or anything, just a big yell). I scared her. I think i'm done with this. I have no choice but to put my kid into day care, regardless if there are so many people in my life saying ""cases are rising!"" ""the pandemic isn't over!"" ""my friend is pulling out her kid, you should too!"" ""they don't test in daycares anymore!"" ""there are so many anti-vaxxers around us!"" ""what if she gets infected?!""

How is everyone doing?","When news of COVID first started to ramp up in mid February of last year, I spent a lot of my some of my nights waking up at 3 am and doom scrolling through pandemic reports. As the virus started to grow in the US, so did my anxiety. Pretty much every night was spent trying to see how fast the virus was spreading and what was being done about it. I was hopeful it wouldn't spread too quickly like previous outbreaks the US has had, but as we all know wrong that was. This was not going to go away anytime soon. I was having minor bouts of panic going into work, trying to keep clean and away from other people. Mandatory mask wearing wasn't a thing just yet, so I felt very susceptible to getting it. I was lucky enough to be sent home for work, where I have been every since. I only left the house to go to get food and outdoor exercise. Days turn to weeks turn to months, my anxiety levels dropped, but like everyone else, I just kept thinking ""when will this end"". It seemed like there was always mixed reporting as to what treatments worked and when a vaccine will come. Some drugs may help but a vaccine was 2ish years away. Then we got the news in December that the first few vaccines were approved. Since then tens of millions of peoples of people have gotten the vaccine. I don't know when it will be my turn, but I see the end in sight. We might be done with this Pandemic by fall or even summer! I know I feel at least better than I did a year ago.

Hi, everyone! How are you?

I'd like to help at least some people out with withstanding quarantine. I've been noticing a lot more memes, posts, comments, and videos online which are focusing on the fact that a lot of people feel like they're being driven insane from the social distancing and quarantining.

I mean, anyone would! Being isolated in any way is difficult for any reason. Even without COVID-19 coming into the picture, it's damn hard to go for prolonged periods of time without the social contact which so many people crave.

Luckily though, I have been isolated (relatively speaking) my whole life; and especially within the past 2 years after having met my fiance, I have largely spent my life in self-isolation. I do my work and school at home, and I've only actually stepped outside maybe a third of the length of time between the start of our relationship and now... most of that was within the first year.

So in all honesty, when I started hearing about COVID-19, the idea that we'd be stuck indoors for the foreseeable future was not any change of pace for me, personally. It's something I've spent my whole life having to adapt to, but which now I fully embrace.

Unfortunately, a lot of the world doesn't have the luxury of experience, or the knowledge of how to survive while socially isolated. So, here are my tips and guidelines on surviving your social isolation/quarantine experience!

Here's what not to do.

1. **DON'T be unhealthy!** Again, this is something I've had trouble with. Rewarding yourself for 10 minutes on a treadmill - even an imaginary treadmill - by ordering Chipotle from Postmates is NOT the same as being healthy. Don't order as much fast food if you can help it. Home-cooked meals are always tastier, healthier, and more fun to make, too.
2. **DON'T be lazy!** Don't use excuses to justify your laziness. If you're telling yourself you can't learn, or you can't be active, or you can't wash your clothes and do the dishes despite being stuck inside all day because you're browsing reddit while having The Clone Wars Season 7 streaming in the background, then you're being a lazy dumbass. Turn off the TV, put down the phone, shut down your computer. Look around you. Look at yourself. What needs to be done? Do it.
3. **DON'T be selfish!** We're all in this thing together. Don't take more than you need in this time: food or water; time alone; breaks; entertainment; etc. Instead, use the time you have to use what you've got to put yourself at a point where you're at the very least stable, and then help others do the same. If and when you have excess, give it to someone who doesn't. If you've got extra cash, food, or clothes, give it to charity. Lots of people need that stuff during the pandemic, and lots more will need it after. If you've got excess time, comfort someone who needs it. Or teach someone who wants to learn a skill which you have. Just don't be selfish by keeping more than what you need.

Here's what to do!

1. **Stay active!** I myself need a lot of help with this, but staying active indoors is a big thing. A little bit of space goes a long way. So instead of using that part of the house where you usually pace as a spot of worrying and stress, turn it into a space where you don't have to do anything different, physically; but where your mental attitude affects whether or not this pacing is healthy. Because, yes, exercising while stressed does help relieve the stress, but if you're just pacing while focusing on your stress, then it doesn't help a whole lot. So if you can, maybe try doing some short-distant sprinting instead of pacing. Maybe combine it with squats, or lunges. Jumping jacks help. So do push-ups and crunches. A lot of Americans might be reading this and thinking, ""Wait, like PE we used to do in school?"" Yes, like PE. You were taught those basic exercises as a kid for a reason.
2. **Stay smart!** So, we're pretty much stuck indoors for who-knows-how-long. School may or may not be in session for a lot of us. If you're in high school or equivalent, I'm sure you might be attending your classes online. If you're a college/university student, I can see that ""might"" turning into a big ""maybe sometimes"" for a lot of you, haha. A lot of people aren't even in school, and haven't been for a while. And yeah, most of us don't like school, or are workers now. But that doesn't mean we have to distance ourselves from learning. So, take the time to learn, whether it be a formal class or not.

* How do you do this? There's a few different ways. Practically speaking, you're gonna want to start teaching yourself any basic skills you've been lacking in life. Not just cooking and cleaning, but also things like plumbing, repair, and basic machinery.
* More abstractly, you can teach yourself any other field you might find interesting. In my experience, school always sucked because it spent so many years forcing me into classes which were not taught effectively, until I was eventually told ""Now pick ONE of those subjects to focus on FOREVER or else YOU WILL BE POOR!"" Not fun. And I'm sure for a lot of you, it's the same way. But now, you have the freedom of the Internet to teach yourself the subjects YOU want to learn, at YOUR pace, with YOUR own way of practicing these skills at home. And you also have people online who have the time now to critique and help you succeed, just as you do too. So learn and teach, everyone!

1. **Look forward, backward, inside, and out!** This is a period where I think a lot of us feel like time is sort of wonky. So we might feel anxious about the present moment, and about the past, and the future, all at the same time; and at a much more intense level than we otherwise would be! But why? In my experience, it's because I never quite dedicated any time to think about my own life, and eventually had enough time on my hands that thinking about it was something I knew at some point I'd have to face. And that the refusal to face it, was what was causing my anxieties. So what I recommend you do is take some of the excess time you have each day to just sit down and... think.

* Look **forward**; plan out the goals and future you would like to accomplish. Not only once the threat of COVID-19 ends, but also while in isolation. Also plan out the steps you'll take to get there, and each part of those steps. Once you have a plan, start taking action. And remember that even if one step can't be done the way you planned, you can always change it to be more flexible while still working toward your goal.
* Look **backward**; reflect on your life choices. Ask yourself uncomfortable questions. We all know that the AITA subreddit is a place of external validation. But so is asking your family and friends if you've ever been the asshole of a given situation. Of course they'll usually say no. But if you ask yourself that. With the benefit of hindsight, put yourself in a ""fly on the wall"" mindset of past events where you might have been the asshole. Even if it was just to yourself. As painful as it is to admit, yes, we've all been assholes. So admit that you've been an asshole. BUT don't use it to pity or self-loathe. Examine why and how you were the asshole, and then going forward, avoid the mindset or circumstances that made you an asshole in the past.
* Look **inside**; Ask yourself who YOU are. What are your values? What are your morals? Can you make a list of values you hold dear? Or how you learned them and practice them? Do you use those values in a hypocritical way, by using them only when they benefit yourself? Or do you actively try and advance those same values for other people too? Yes, ***even and especially*** if it's going out of your way. Can you sum up your values into a single word? Can you sum up your moral code (how you live by those values for yourself and so that others can too) in three sentences? Don't stop thinking about this each day until you can. Also ask yourself if anything you're doing in your daily life causes you anxieties. Take this time to grow.
* Look **out**; Look around you. Take time to appreciate the life you do have. You have a roof over your head, food in the pantry, and clothes to wear. That's more than a lot of people could ever afford. Never mind anything else you've got. Appreciate how you got to where you are right now. It might not seem like heaven, but at least it isn't hell. So look around you at the world you know, and the things you have, and ask yourself questions like: Do I appreciate everything I have? Is this thing I have actually worth keeping, or would it be better elsewhere? Who helped me get the things I have? Who taught me important lessons which I can remind myself of with the stuff I have? And, don't be afraid to ""look out"" in the more common way. Look out for any potential dangers to your mental and physical health you're being exposed to, and try your best to fix the situations.

\---

Some people might be reading this and thinking, ""Whoa, look at this guy! He's using COVID-19 as a soapbox to tell us how to live our lives! You think you're so moral, buddy? Well FUCK YOU!"" If you're one of those people, I can't stop you from thinking that. And I wouldn't want to force you to change your mindset. Take it or leave it, it's your call.

Other people might read this and just ""get it"". Congratulations!

And some other people - I think maybe the majority of people - who read this are sort of in the middle. You might be confused as to how or why this weird post which talks about morality so much helps anyone with dealing with COVID-19. But a part of you thinks it does.

Well, if you're in that group, then I'll explain it to you. Does this post help with COVID-19? No. I never said it does! It's supposed to help you deal with the isolation we're all going through so you don't go insane.  And once COVID-19 is over and done with, then if you've taken this post to heart, you can keep using the skills you've learned and practiced to help others in their own situations - whether because of social isolation or not.

If you'd asked me a few years ago to read this post and answer the question, ""how can this help you, right now?"" Then I, as someone who was maybe between 19-21, wouldn't have been able to answer. But by learning to use my isolation to learn about myself, I learned to enjoy it. And from there, I learned to help other people. And from there, I learned how to enjoy life as much as I can, whether I'm by myself or with others.

And I hope that everyone who reads this, and who normally spends their time with others, and not enough time with themselves, uses this post to guide them. We're in a spot in life where a lot of us are just spending so much time by ourselves, indoors. Lots of people are feeling cooped-up because now they have to spend more time alone than otherwise.

Don't run away from the alone time. Embrace it. Learn about yourself. And then, when you CAN spend time with others, use this time you'd spent learning how to be a better person to make the enjoyment of life more fun for everyone involved.

I had been doing more and feeling a lot better but since Delta hit I know a lot of people with breakthrough infections and it makes me not want to do anything.

On the other hand when I get out and do things I feel better but the ""rebound"" anxiety is awful.. I just feel super stuck and like I am waking up to a nightmare that never ends. I know logically this virus will end or become endemic and life will go on but right now my optimism is running low and my mental health is at its breaking point.

"2021-09-10",1631240788,"Morbid Needle Fear","I've been deathly afraid of needles me entire life but have decided to get the COVID vaccine on Sunday. Just a few years back I was hit by a car and so terrified that if I went to the hospital, I'd be forced to get a shot that I tried to walk home on a broken ankle. My fear is just that all consuming. I also tried to avoid going to the hospital when I had kidney stones and when I finally went I refused a shot of pain medicine despite the horrendous pain I was in. I think many people don't understand what it's like to have a needle phobia. It's so much worse than people realize.

But, I really want to get vaccinated. I'm going this Sunday and have a support group of three people to join me. I'm honestly hoping the peer pressure of having them there and doing it in an open pharmacy where people can see will me will create enough peer pressure that I don't flip out and panic. I hope it works. I can get lido shots at the dentist without issue so I KNOW I can get shots..but for some reason, if it's not a shot in my gums, I'm mortified of it. I've had three teeth pulled in the past year and I'd rather undergo that again than this..but I'm trying to be a brave little toaster and just deal with it and do this.

I HAVE to do this. I'm hoping by not putting it off and going on my first available day too I won't be as afraid. And I do have rather strong lidocaine cream and it does work quite well so I hope that will help with some of my fear the same way when the dentist numbs your gums before doing the shot helps a tiny bit. I'm still expecting this to suck but my hope is that by the end of it I'll be less afraid of shots in general. I genuinely believe I can get to that point..it's just really REALLY hard.

Trying to focus on the positive things in my life. This is one small thing I can do for my own sake and for those around me. I hope if I can do it, others can do it too.

While it's still not easy, I got my buddy for holding my hand, I got my plushie for cuddles, while I don't have a juice box I do have my favorite banana milk chilling in the fridge ready to go in my bag, I got headphones for music, my mom (a nurse) gave me really great advice too for speaking with the tech about my fears and she venmoed me $30 to go get a Taco Bell feast afterwards, and I got my lido cream I can put on prior to the appointment. It won't be easy but..I really hope this is the first step in helping overcome my phobia. I've gotten over a lot of fears this year (including getting my driving license at 32). Life is scary sometimes but occasionally we get opportunities to make things better for ourselves even in the midst of such a horrible pandemic. Thank you to everyone for all your support.

"2021-09-29",1632891944,"I'm so tired of this pandemic","The only thing that bugs me is how Covid causes so many symptoms shared by practically everything else. I'm tired of getting tested every time I don't feel good. 

For instance, I came home from work on the 7th and started sneezing and had bad congestion. The first thing that popped into my mind, Covid. So I do an at-home test, on the 13th negative, I kept sneezing so I do the second at-home test Wednesday negative. Still sneezing, went to the clinic that same day and got tested, negative. Still sneezing but now with a sore throat, I wait a few days and get tested that Friday, negative.

It went away for a few days and came back and I ended up having a sneezing fit with a slight cough at night. Last Thursday I got a drive-thru PCR test because I haven't stopped sneezing. Got the results back, Sunday negative. Today, still sneezing with a runny nose.
 
I had Covid in October of last year and my first symptom was sneezing. So ever since I've been soooo paranoid about getting it again. Especially since I live with immunocompromised people.

I had a blood drawn allergy test earlier this month and it was negative for everything.

I'm tired of every time this happens I start trying to play ""connect the dots"" to wonder if I've been exposed. I know those that are vaxxed will get ""mild"" symptoms and are less likely to be hospitalized or die or the long haul is cut by 50%. But I'm not seeing is any mention of is whether those who are vaxxed have any damage such as myocarditis or anything else that happens with those unvaxxed or if it exacerbates problems for those who got Covid a previous time.

Edit: Don't want to cause any confusion, double vaxxed Moderna since April had Covid October of last year. Also the part at the end I'm referring to those who catch Covid after being double vaxxed. Will it exacerbate problems caused by someone's first bout with it or are those vaxxed still have to worry about myocarditis or any other problems after an infection like those who are unvaxxed.","COVID19_support",22,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/pxoeti/im_so_tired_of_this_pandemic/"
"2020-09-07",1599446378,"If a vaccine doesn't ultimately end all social distancing, what does?","In the US for context.

I'm not a COVID denier in any way, shape, or form. I realize that information changes, and that much was and still is uncertain about this disease, the long term impacts, and how long immunity lasts. But lately I've been pretty exasperated with the shifting goalposts on what will actually end social distancing.  (By ""social distancing,"" I mean limits on crowds, quarantine periods upon arrival, not being able to go to a school or work setting without restriction, and the like. Mandatory mask wearing too I suppose, although that will probably just stick around for a while voluntarily, which is fine by me; I plan on wearing a mask when I'm sick or in bad flu seasons from now on.) In March, a lot of people got the idea that it would end with \~1-2 months lockdown. Maybe it could have been better by a lot if we had actual testing and quarantine plans, but I guess that wasn't meant to be. Then we started to hear ""no, we need some degree of social distancing until there's a vaccine, or very effective treatment, or the virus just burns itself out."" Ok, that's rough, but we can probably live with that, especially if said testing plans come on line...eventually.

Now it's looking quite likely that there will be a vaccine, maybe starting wide distribution as early as late winter next year, but it's probably not going to be as effective as, say, the measles vaccine. With that understanding has come a flurry of interviews, headlines, and op-eds talking about how a vaccine won't end the crisis overnight (ok, we knew that) and that some forms of social distancing will remain necessary ""for the forseeable future."" And when people say the ""crisis will end"" as this article does ([https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/09/americas-coronavirus-ordeal-wont-end-when-2020-does/616108/](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/09/americas-coronavirus-ordeal-wont-end-when-2020-does/616108/)), it's always couched in terms like, quoting Dr. Fauci, by the time we get around through 2021, we can start having some form of normality. Maybe not exactly the way it was, but certainly different than what were doing right now.

First of all, when is ""around through 2021?"" Is it this time in 2021 or on January 1, 2022? More importantly, does that mean that ""some form of normality"" is the best we'll ever get? Because that sure sounds a lot like...right now, at least in regions where cases are below 500/day. HOW does society continue to function if that's the case? It basically sounds like seeing people, gathering for religious services, education, community gatherings, or just spending time, supporting people who need a leg up, travelling, having a sense of purpose beyond a desk and computer in your house or apartment that doesn't involve terror about capturing a novel coronavirus that could attack your heart and lungs for the rest of your life if you can't work from home are gone for good.

Some of it is caution, sure, and some of it is probably the media's love of alarmist headlines that drive doomscrolling. I've got no problems with wearing masks and being careful in order to keep people safe. And yes, one can expect some changes to stick around even in the best case, and that's probably good (more flexibility on sick time, more flexibility with working from home, symptom screening for visits at nursing homes and crossing international borders). But the more I hear claims like that, the more it seems like we're stuck in this cloistered life forever, or at least for about a decade or so. Heck, New Zealand tried to outright eliminate the virus by locking down until community spread was gone; they did, and were basically able to reopen everything including huge soccer stadiums...and somehow, the virus came back, and the best they can do is ""level 2"" restrictions now.

For my part, permanent social distancing basically means what I want to do with my life is worthless, and I have to figure out a new career path which I won't be nearly as competent at. I had a more speculative ""fallback"" option that for various reasons hasn't been active for a year and is even more in the toilet than my main goal, so that's not really an option either. Maybe I'm just a bad person for caring about that and wanting normality. Maybe that means I don't care about other people, though I certainly think I care. But I just don't see how society continues to function if this really is the new, permanent, normal.

So if we're not getting a 100% effective vaccine, and the virus isn't going to go away like SARS-CoV-1 did, is there ANY threshold that allows ALL social distancing to end at some point? Obviously nobody can predict when this would be likely to happen. And I'm not looking for a debate on the relative wisdom of different jurisdictions' current policies. I'm asking WHAT thresholds have to be met. Or are there none, and this is just life now?","COVID19_support",27,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/inzaou/if_a_vaccine_doesnt_ultimately_end_all_social/"

I am a 27 year old female. I have type 2 diabetes and my latest blood sugar is 8.7, which isn't great, I know. I am vaccinated, and got a booster back in March.

On Thanksgiving (11/24) I woke up to an tchy and dry throat. Thats all I felt, so I thought it was my allergies acting up, I tend to get a lot of symptoms in the winter time. I tested just in case knowing I was going to spend the day with my family. The result was negative. I live at home with my mom and dad and sister. My fiance came over too and we spent the day all together as normal. I was nervous about doing this but my family assured me that I was going to be okay. My mom also told me she did not feel good that day (nose pain/congestion,) but also tested negative, so we thought we were both maybe developing a cold.

Next day (11/25) my mom tests positive. I test again, and am negative.

I didn't test positive until yesterday, Sunday (11/27). In those two days in between I didn't leave the house much because I was afraid, and now I'm staying home until I'm better. I have to go into work while everyone else is gone to grab paperwork and do it at home which sucks.

I do have a slight fever (99.5). I also have a very itchy throat. Its not painful, just so itchy I want to scratch it. I am congested and coughing a lot too, especially at night when I go to bed.

I am so anxious about this. My mom who basically started having symptoms the same day as me, is already feeling a lot better. I do not feel much better so far. My throat is still as itchy as it was 4 days ago. I am terrified it is going to get worse for me and I am going to die. I keep reading about how people with diabetes have a higher chance of developing longer symptoms of covid. My symptoms could be worse, I am just so scared they will continue and get worse over time. I keep crying and thinking of me possibly missing my fiances birthday (12/16) I have a big party planned that I have spent a lot of money on, missing Christmas festivities, missing my wedding day..... I know I shouldn't be thinking this way but I can't help it.... I have managed to avoid covid for so long, and knowing I have it now is really breaking me.

(Throwaway acct for reasons.)

**Backstory**: (skip ahead to the question if you don't care)

I'm a 41yo male in the US (Michigan). I've never been especially healthy. Asthma, childhood lung damage, ADHD, overweight (5'6, 200lbs), etc.- I was paranoid about Covid because I was a walking pre-existing condition. I've been a virtual shut-in for the past year, leaving the house less than a dozen times since March 2020 and working from home since then. To top it off, I found out I'm diabetic in December. I was excited when got my first pfizer shot on Tuesday, March 30th.

On Tuesday, April 6th (1 week later), I started feeling unwell- exhaustion, brainfog, extreme stomach and intestinal cramps, and (humorously) extreme flatulence and burping. I mean EXTREME flatulence and burping. By Thursday, April 8th (2 days later) my wife took me to Urgent Care at 10am. Doc called it Gastroenteritis, suggested Tagamet, and said it could be caused by Covid. My wife and I laughed. They gave me a quick test which came back negative, and the PCR test that would be back in a few days.

The results came back Monday April 12th- I was positive for Covid. They estimated that I was exposed on April 1st or 2nd. So I checked Google Timeline. I confirmed that I hadn't left the house between 3/30 and 4/4 other than a short walk when it was nice out. I wore a mask and kept my distance from the few people I saw.

I was told I would be non-contagious on April 16th. I slept by myself, ate by myself, and lived in my office away from the rest of the family. On April 19th, my wife and kids took PCR tests to determine if they had contracted it or were asymptomatic carriers. All three were negative.

We did everything right. Kids have done virtual learning all year, we used Shipt for grocery deliveries, and only my wife went out when it couldn't be avoided. We have no idea how I got it.

It's been a week since the gas and cramps ended (the Tagamet was magic), but the exhaustion and brainfog stayed. From April 6th until April 17th, I slept 12-18 hours a day. I'm still sleeping 12 hours a day, and can barely stay awake for 4-6 hours at a time during the day without taking a 2+ hour nap. It's worth noting that I'm on Vyvanse (an amphetamine) for ADHD and drink a french press of coffee a day and I'm still exhausted, plus I now have the attention span and focus of a goldfish.

I started a new job in Feb 2020, and began working remote full time one month later. I work in IT and rely on my 20 years of experience and attention to detail to excel at my job. I've always tried hard to do my job well and still keep my work/life balance. I've almost always get positive reviews from my managers (despite my imposter syndrome) and get positive feedback from my colleagues.

While my boss and employer in general have been understanding, I missed a virtual-meeting today (11am) because I laid down (10:30am) and fell asleep until 1pm (when a reminder for another meeting went off on my phone). I had woken up at 7:30am and had over 8 hours of sleep last night. I spoke with my boss who has been super understanding and tells me my health is my #1 priority, but I fear that at some point I'll just become a drag on the team. I can't be effective like this.

To top it off, my team has lost 2 team members in the past month and another two are going to be going on paternity leave this month. That will leave us with 4 people besides me. My team is terribly understaffed now, and they are going to need me to step up as one of the ""Senior"" guys. I don't think I can.

(TL;DR I got covid and am now constantly exhausted w/ brainfog)

**Question**

Given my career (knowledge worker), my exhaustion, and my brain fog, how can continue working like this? If this is my ""long covid,"" how can I do my job in a way that is fair to my team? While I generally don't feel bad for corporations, I do feel that I'm not keeping up my end of the bargain.

If I was to suddenly lose my job, I don't think I'd make it through an interview, which is a problem because I'm the primary breadwinner and my wife has been a stay-at-home mom for the past 14 years. When I eventually have to go back to the office (either this job or the next), should I bring a sleeping bag and pillow? make a pillow fort under my desk? How do I work when I can't stay awake for a work day?

I'm sure I'm not the only one going through something like this. Realistically, what are my options? If this is my new normal, should I be looking into disability? It feels absurd, but it also feels accurate.

I'm losing patience, or maybe I've lost it a long time ago. I know this is difficult for everyone, and I'm not trying to undermine that everyone is struggling one way or another, but precisely because of that, I feel like my own worries and struggles are downplayed by people around me (my family, friends, colleagues). 

I'm reading here on reddit that you guys in other countries are already getting your vaccines. I want mine too. But in my country, first the medical staff was vaccinated, and then the vaccines started to be distributed to elderly people first. It's going so slowly that a healthy person in their 30s, like myself, won't get it anytime soon. It pisses me off, because at the end of 2020 everyone was so hopeful for the vaccine, everyone was literally WAITING for it, so why is everything so poorly prepared now? I constantly read on the news that there are not enough doses, that the healthcare system is overwhelmed with making appointments etc. ok WTF? For a year I've been hearing that ""just wait until the vaccine is ready, everything will be back to normal soon enough"", and now vaccine is ready and suddenly everyone realized that it's not so easy? I'm so angry about this, it's so frustrating because there is nothing I can do about this.

I'm tired of working from home, I'm tired of being alone. I have no normal routine anymore, I'm not seeing my colleagues. And yet my job expects of me to keep up the same motivation, and the same level of performance as normal. It's starting to become really difficult for me. But of course I can't complain because ""we are all in this together"" and my co-workers are facing the same, right? So why would MY struggle be important? 

Whenever I talk to my mom, reaching out to her for support, she says things like ""at least you didn't lose your job, be grateful"" or ""at least you are healthy"" as if I'm not recognizing it or not being grateful. I am. But this doesn't change the fact that the overall situation is starting to become unbearable for me, and I've exhausted all means of trying to distract myself or make myself feel better.

Fortunately but also unfortunately, I have found an extremely isolating job where I make decent money but work entirely virtually. This, too, is sucking my soul dry.

I graduated last semester, and being in my mid twenties, my life feels as if it is just flying right by, my prime years, gone.

All I can do is keep making money and try to eventually do things with it. I don't know. Feeling a bit fucked right now. This is the first time in my life I haven't had a best friend, let alone any friends. I gave them up because I had to, I had to grow, and here I am, isolated.

Not so much lonely as I am numb. Before this job, I was focused on growing my spirituality and relationship with myself and the universe; this job makes it extremely difficult, I still try to meditate though.

But, I'm not here to be pessimistic. Time changes everything, and as depressing life can be, it is also in the opposite spectrum, equally beautiful. I just pray, and have faith, things will change, one day, one grain at a time.

I'm actually planning a mushrooms trip soon; hopeful these give me insight.

"2020-10-24",1603504890,"Just need some support right now","I \[21F\] am really struggling to progress with my life and find reasons to stay afloat in the midst of this COVID-19 mess. I'm in my 4th year of college (though I'm not expected to graduate until 2022, thankfully), and the new ""hybrid"" (aka almost completely online) mode of classes at my school has been really problematic overall this semester. I had to drop 2 classes out of the 4 classes I originally planned to complete this semester for COVID-related reasons -- one class had technical issues every day with making lectures accessible for those attending remotely, and the other was taught by a demanding professor who became defensive and regularly made threats (e.g. making the final exam worth 90%+ of our overall class grade, making us use Honorlock instead of open notes to complete all exams, shortening ""open-note"" quick quizzes that were already only 10 minutes long to reduce ability to look at notes, etc.) in response to us simply asking questions about the format of the course -- and it's so difficult to stay motivated in the 2 classes I am taking due to how depressing everything is right now, in addition to how depressing things already were right before COVID due to my grandfather's passing near the end of 2019 and the increased anxiety and depression I experienced immediately following his passing.

I'm also autistic (was diagnosed at the age of 4), and partly as a result of this, I have struggled to make friends in the traditional sense my whole life. I very frequently had no friends I could socialize with during my growing-up years (despite my own efforts to take initiative and reach out to people), and even when I did have a few good friends, I've nearly always had to be the one to reach out in order for socialization to be possible. Even then, nearly all of them eventually left in favor of ""better"" friends (I feel very much like a back-up/convenience friend as a result of this), and it has resulted in me feeling very unwanted, unloved, and lonely with abandonment issues. These feelings have only gotten worse during the pandemic, especially since it's even harder to talk with others right now and I constantly hear about how much harder it apparently is to make friends after college.

Another weird thing I've noticed with my social life is that older adults (family friends, former teachers, other older adults in the community) tend to gravitate toward me (and vise versa) much more easily than to many same-age people I know, whereas I really struggle with making and especially maintaining friendships with people near my age. I don't really know why this is the case, though people have said I am mature for my age and an ""old soul"", so maybe this contributes? Either way, it feels almost wrong/taboo that this is the case (though I have enjoyed the friendships I've made with older adults), and I wish it was easier to make friends near my age (in addition to the older adult friendships I've maintained), in part due to a fear of being alone after the older adults I know pass on.

I also have a difficult time dealing with even minor uncertainty/changes of plan/spontaneity, partly as a result of being autistic, so the constant feelings of major uncertainty resulting from the pandemic have resulted in my brain being in a constant haywire mode. (When will I be able to see higher-risk family and friends again? I, fortunately, got an internship offer recently for Summer 2021 -- what will the pandemic situation look like then? When will all of this end? 2021? 2022? Never?! Nobody even knows the stages of getting out of this pandemic -- though it doesn't help that our administration in the U.S. is a joke -- let alone when it will end, if ever.)

On top of all of that, I also have a semi-abusive home situation (my mother has been incredibly supportive of me my whole life, but she gets angry and starts yelling at my dad and/or me very easily as a result of a dysfunctional childhood, and I sometimes don't even know what I did that caused her to start yelling at me until after the yelling starts) that made things worse when I was forced to leave my college campus and return home to my parents in March. Staying at home, 24/7 (my parents are working from home now because of COVID), for 5 months with a mother whose tendency to scold, argue, and/or yell over every little thing worsened (understandably) because of pandemic-induced stress (both my parents take the pandemic very seriously, thankfully, she was just stressed about the situation and other people not taking it seriously) was not a pleasant experience, and I'm a little nervous about going back to my parents' house for a month and a half during Thanksgiving Break due to not knowing how to effectively handle these situations (I've lost count of the number of times I had to excuse myself from dinner before dinner even started because my parents would not stop arguing and/or yelling at each other at the table, and at one point this summer my mom started full-on screaming and slamming doors at my dad and me for the first time since she abused alcohol during my middle school years).

I'm typically a very ambitious person who cares about doing the best I can in what I do to progress toward long-term goals in life, but at this point, I don't really have any dreams I'm excited about at all, and I'm honestly just trying to get through the semester and make sure I'm actually still alive at the end of it all (I have had suicidal thoughts on and off since May, and while I am currently in counseling for anxiety and depression, it hasn't been enough to overcome the overwhelming dark thoughts I experience so frequently), and even then, it's hard to have any hope anymore with the current pandemic and with climate change looming just around the corner.","COVID19_support",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jh0olj/just_need_some_support_right_now/"

I live in the sf bay area which has been frustrating because we're super strict about covid which has made making friends much more difficult. Yet even though we're doing everything right we're still having record breaking cases. Things are getting canceled again just like March 2020. And more people are now less willing to meet new people or even people they already know. Over the summer and fall I tried going to meetup groups to meet new people and I never could really find the right group of people. And now it looks like I'll have to wait till the summer to even be able to try and find new friends again. I spoke to my therapist about my struggles to find people I can connect well with and she told me because I'm not willing to do zoom calls I'm probably not gonna get anywhere towards making new friends for a long time. And one of my closest friends got upset at me for going to EDC Orlando last month and going to Disneyland with my mom last week. I was scared to even post that I went to edc Orlando a month ago because my friend wouldn't approve of it. I still have a super hard time convincing myself that 2022 will be any better.

"2020-12-04",1607118124,"I have to accept the fact that I won't be OK again.","Before I start this post, I want to apologize if this comes off as rambly at all. I just need to let my thoughts out.

This past year has destroyed my mental health. Before this, I was in college and was taking steps to better myself. I was sent home in March, and had to spend last spring and this fall taking classes in my room alone. To say that these past 8 months destroyed my mental health would be an understatement. 

To start, I'm stuck in the closet at home for the forseeable future, so I couldn't bind or dress or be referred to the way I would like to. My friends from college mostly didn't keep in touch, and this fall, my two friends who live in my town went back to school and because they had their lives back, they didn't talk to me at all. I felt completely isolated, and could go over a week without talking to anyone besides my parents. And even if my friends would talk to me, it was a quick text-nothing more. This semester is also the most intense for my major, and I'm absolutely piled with work. Plus, the Earth in general just feels overwhelmingly depressing. Like, sunsets used to be my favorite time of day, and I feel like the sky hasn't even had an actual sunset since March. Nothing has any life anymore.

Every day for the past 8 months has been the same- wake up, stare at my phone, stare at my computer, sleep, rinse and repeat.  I don't even have any memories of this year, at all. Its just a big blank in my head. The only healthy coping mechanism I have is running, and now its even getting too cold for that. Between the anxiety from the news, the stress from school, the loneliness, the emptiness I feel every day, the overwhelming depressing content on social media, I just feel empty inside. I can't care about anyone or anything anymore. I've never felt this terrible in my life before. I made plans to kill myself two times this year; I was planning on doing it over the summer  and on November 1st, but I chickened out each time. The worst part is that I regret not doing it. The literal only thing keeping me from planning on trying again is that I'm getting a Playstation for Christmas. 

My school announced that we're doing this spring semester online again too-so that means another 5 months of this hell. Over a year and a half of feeling trapped. I really feel like I'm not gonna make it. My parents keep telling me that the end is near because we're getting the vaccine, but it's hard to feel hopeful. The goalposts keep moving so many times that it's hard to feel anything. I feel like my mental health has been damaged to the point beyond repair. I feel like even if I go to therapy, I'm never going to be the same way that I was before the pandemic. I'm going to carry this with me for the rest of my life. How do I live with this? How do I accept that I'm never going to feel OK again?","COVID19_support",13,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/k6u930/i_have_to_accept_the_fact_that_i_wont_be_ok_again/"

In the press conference, they admitted to have no scientific evidence to support the use of the curfew, but that's not stopping them. The only thing that was holding me together was occasionally seeing my friends who live alone, which was allowed, but they just banned that too. I don't doubt that things will get better at some point, but I don't think I can make it until then. I can't risk getting the fine because, since I lost my job because of the restrictions, that would financially ruin me, so even if I still go to see my friends illegally, I might get caught walking back home.

It was fortunate timing - just as the world was about to disassociate, she found a coherent group to bond with, and a common cause to rally to. 

I too was freelance when it hit, and I too was looking for an office job. I was in many interviews, but gradually I realized that all the jobs I could get would be WFH anyway, because of COVID. And so I stuck to developing my own niche as a freelance writer.

But I wish I had what she has - people you can see, masked or not, in an office most days. Even if they drive you mad, sometimes. It's so humanizing - the struggle to accept other people.

So we are, at the moment, unequally served in how much human contact we can get to sustain us. 

For me, I think of all those trivial social events I miss - the cinema; lunch with friends (indoors in winter as necessary); the real-life pub quiz...unlike my partner, there is nothing that can substitute those minor little periods of hours where you talk nonsense, and know that you are in the world and of the world.

Work has had a significant amount of cases, but it's an essential job that can't go WFH. Initially people weren't taking this seriously but since the company implemented mandatory masks it seems like they've finally started accepting it as a real thing. For me, it's sent me spiraling.

I've been having major anxiety over the pandemic for months now on and off, and I was one of the first ones to carry hand sanitizer with me and put a mask on, though I wish I was better about using it and mask hygiene if I'm honest. I'm 32 years old, but I'm extremely overweight and I might have underlying issues with heart and kidney (I don't know for certain, I can't go to a doctor and check). I'm pretty high risk, and even if I survive getting it my finances are such that even if I just need to take a test the $200 cost and the days off waiting for the results might mean I don't make rent, let alone if I actually catch it or worse yet end up having to go to a hospital.

"2020-05-27",1590544577,"Working from home is giving me severe anxiety and depression","I'm just needing to vent a moment, please bare with me.

So I work a job that is very stressful on the most normal of days - I do customer service via e-mail and phone support for a company that deals with the transportation of parcels. As is probably well known right now, everyone is buying things online and package volumes are higher than even during Christmas time. It's causing severe stress to an already stressful job, and the senders of these packages are oftentimes business owners. Because they're stressed due to the delay of packages thanks to COVID, they end up taking their frustration out on us. The word for today's post is 'stress' clearly.

Back in March, us CSRs were instructed to work from home and we have been ever since. While some people celebrate being able to WFH, I found that as someone with pre-existing anxiety and depression, the cler separation from work and home for me was needed to maintain my mental health. As I began working from home, it only took a few weeks for my anxiety and depression to become out of control - my apartment is extremely tiny, and I share it with my partner and cat. I unfortunately do not have a room I can lock myself in, so my cat ends up distracting me severely as she is quite needy and it messes with my productivity. Furthermore, because I take phone calls all day for my job, I've been told that my WFH arrangement also stresses out my partner as my headset can pick up the slightest noise and he can't behave like he normally does, needing to be quiet. So this arrangement doesn't only affect me but my family.

In a fit of desperation, I spoke to my doctor and she has prescribed me Prozac, which I actually seem to be acclimating to fairly well. However, the side-effects are a bit gnarly and that, along with everything else, is affecting my productivity. 

Working from home with my job has added a whole layer of complexity that is making me burnout and have breakdowns and depresive episodes in ways I never did when I was in the office. All I want to do is quit my job as I have enough for 3 months worth of bills saved up, but I know it might not be smart as who knows what the job market will look like in the future because of COVID.

Overall, my living situation (and myself) isn't suited for WFH, but my employer is giving me no other choice but to do this. For right now, we have no idea when we'll be back in the office, and that uncertainty is killing me even more. But I know if I quit, I won't get any ongoing unemployment benefits and my money will be gone in three months. My partner has already lost his job because of COVID, and is getting unemployment benefits but they are less than what he was making at his last job.

I am at a loss on what to do. My rational mind says it isn't smart to quit with only 3 months worth of savings under my belt, but I am suffering so tremendously that I'm not sure how long I ccan go on before having a full-on mental breakdown.","COVID19_support",7,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/grajwk/working_from_home_is_giving_me_severe_anxiety_and/"

I'm not a social butterfly by any means and have had social anxiety in the past, but I was just starting to enjoying being around people, socializing after work etc pre-COVID. Now myself and colleagues (1000+) have been told that on return, we can come into the office and work, but all teams will be mixed together, and most people will be working from home - probably just a few. This means that I'll be working with a handful of people (who I don't work directly and do different roles completely).

What makes me feel worse is that most people don't want to return to work. They have families, friends and good home lives which means not going into an office is no great loss to them. But for me, it *was* my social life.

I know I shouldn't be complaining, I have a job, I've not got COVID and I'm surviving.

Eventually, I found my hack, which was spending hours at the library and barrelling through the course work needed to be done. Ended up graduating successfully, even though I procrastinated my way through my degree. In February 2020, I broke up with my boyfriend of 4 years, but I also got my first job- it was WFH normally but I found my rhythm working from the public library. At the time, I saw the change as necessary and really looked forward to the next stage of my life... as in being able to save&amp;invest money, pay off my loans, grow my social circle, join fitness classes. Not 4 weeks later, March hit &amp; you know what happened. This vision of seriously working on my mental health healing/recovery &amp; focusing on my personal+professional development was the light at the end of my tunnel of what's honestly been a lifetime of anxiety-induced self-isolation anyway. I was willing and energetic about my potential for the first in a long while. Now... I just feel like... I'm stuck in the same lonely teen/young adult dimension, which has real repercussions that I do not know how to remedy. I have a pile of incomplete work tasks/responsibilities dating back to March, and intrusive thoughts about my ex frequently come up (even though I cut off contact with him), making me hate myself more than usual. I absolutely loathe WFH because I cannot concentrate, I have no discipline. I miss my library. I don't know what to do. I don't want to think about my ex. I don't want to lose my job.

"2021-02-17",1613585190,"Reconciling friendships who flaunted the pandemic?","Some background: I'm in the U.S., married, no kids, already full-time WFH before the pandemic, and spouse transitioned to WFH at pandemic start. This put us in the ideal situation to weather the pandemic and adhere to the strictest precautions, which we did. We haven't been in a building that wasn't our home since March, and we haven't been within 10 feet of another human being except the occasional drive-thru worker. I have nothing to do with my family, and spouse's live very far away.

&amp;#x200B;

We've kept in touch with friends via zooms and Discords and such, but it became obvious around October of last year that our friends were not taking the same precautions that we were. Fully understanding that some still had in-person jobs or other unavoidable but less-than-safe obligations, we starting noticing more and more of our friends were doing entirely avoidable unsafe things--hanging out in groups outside their households, traveling and visiting family and friends, participating in indoor athletic events--basically all the things most of the country has been doing to keep the pandemic going as long as it has.

I didn't think much of it at first, but it hit me around December as a friend recounted a story of going to a bar the previous day that I had a real issue with their behavior. These were otherwise very intelligent people choosing to do very dumb things *multiple times*, and I quickly found myself wanting to interact virtually with them less and less. The final straw was when one of them who lives a few hours away was rather insistent on meeting up with us at her sibling's house near us and reacted belligerently when we said no. This was our last friend who had been taking the same precautions as us to that point, and they decided the peak of the pandemic was the right time to stop.

My spouse has still kept in virtual touch with our common friends, which I fully support, but I've avoided those same friends because I am just not okay with any of them. With a potential end of the pandemic somewhere on the horizon, I know the day will come where I'll have to decide how/whether to reconcile the poor choices we've seen our friends make, and I'm not sure I can ever be okay with any of our friends, all of whom have done completely avoidable, reckless things.

I am at a loss as to how to proceed. I see no benefit in calling them out; they knew what they were doing was foolish and would endanger themselves and others, many are still doing these things, and none seem to regret their choices. Even if I made the drastic decision to start fresh with new friends, would I encounter a similar issue if I learn they did the same kind of things during the pandemic? As the weeks tick on, I'm finding it less likely that I can just let this go and give everyone a free pass for being dangerously selfish. ""I stayed home, why couldn't you?"" has become a question I can't ignore and one that seems to have no acceptable answers.

I was an exuberant extrovert before the pandemic, but I'm concerned I may now be a permanent extreme introvert because I won't be able to get over people who willfully put themselves and others (the ""and others"" clause is what is particularly troubling to me) at risk when they didn't have to. Anyone else feeling the same way? Any thoughts on how to convince myself I should let this go or something else I could do to address this that I hadn't considered?","COVID19_support",11,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/lm0mor/reconciling_friendships_who_flaunted_the_pandemic/"

While most of my coworkers were really happy with the news, I wasn't. That's because I'm 34 years old, still living with my parents, with no perspective of finding any relationships (in other words, I suck at Tinder) or even making friends.

While a few extra hours of sleep are always a good thing, the lack of social contact (and the absence of a virtual equivalent to the ""watercooler"") is bad. I was hopeful we would be back to the office (albeit a smaller one) by the time we've had enough people vaccinated (probably early next year), but now it's all gone.

My  workplace has undergone a huge transformation, which means that the default model is working from home. You can work in the office for mental health reasons (such as if you live alone). I go in one day a week...but it's not the same. I don't know half the people now, and the atmosphere which made the job enjoyable has just gone. 

My role has been changed, and the promised promotion given to somebody else, because I was struggling with the solitude, and spending 90% of my waking hours in one room.

In 2019, I met a guy, sparks flew between us, and we were going to meet up. He lives in a different country. It has just fizzled out.

My self esteem has plummeted as my weight has rocketed. Partly from food, but mainly because I always walked around a lot in the office.

Just before Xmas, I crashed badly. I could barely eat, couldn't stop crying, couldn't focus on anything (there was something behind this that I won't go into detail on). I spent the Xmas break at my mom's, and also saw my dad, which lifted me a bit.

Now I am back home, I tested positive for covid yesterday, which means at least a week of solitary confinement. And I'm symptomatic, which has led to me losing my voice so I can't even speak to anyone on the phone. Which is not good as I've been on and off crying since I got back. And my throat is so sore, hurts to cough, hurts to swallow. I'm just at the point where I'm really not coping.

covid situation in my region: 275-295 new covid patients a day (worse than same time last year), QR-codes everywhere but grocery shops, drugstores, and public transport within the town, 50% of adult population is at least partially vaccinated

what i already do to protect myself: wear a mask, WFH (i'm currently a freelancer, i literally have no choice), no public transport (i only use a taxi now), decided to stop attending even small mass events since last saturday and decided to stop attending bars since last night

what i currently can't avoid: 

- in-person dj classes (i thought of an academic leave for work-related reasons but the course i started in september ends in a month, it would be stupid to do that) once a week, as far as i know, my teachers and two groupmates are fully vaccinated

- visiting my fully vaccinated parents (i would fucking die of loneliness + i go to their house to work bc i can't concentrate at my place)

- seeing my fully vaccinated friends at least sometimes (same thing, my mental health would decline rapidly and i already have depression)

- having some outdoor time alone or with friends (i would feel like crap without some fresh air and physical activity), the area where i live has enough space and not too many people, which means no crowds

- in-person grocery shopping (no one delivers cigarettes lol + more control over expiration dates and stuff + my area is pretty remote)

what i technically can avoid:

- at this school where i learn to dj we have sort of practice parties every week where everyone can play a 20-minute set, the crowd is usually like 20-30 people tops but i don't know about their vaccination status. i can quit them, it's not a mandatory thing but i need those to improve my skill without paying a huge amount of money to rent the room and equipment, and work on my violent stage anxiety.

what else can i do? should i change my lifestyle to make it more covid-proof or my current measures are fine? how long should i avoid public transport? taxis are pretty expensive if you use them on a regular basis (rn i have at least 4 rides per week). i feel like i'm getting more and more anxious about public places, i quit using buses because of severe panic attacks. i don't feel like isolating myself even more would do any good to me but do i have a choice in this situation? hell no.","COVID19_support",14,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/qy3oxa/need_a_lifestyle_advice_for_the_next_month/"

I ended up getting a new job that starts next week and am confident that they will allow me to WFH in pretty short order, so I'm thankful there.

I'm not jonesing to eat inside bars/restaurants or go shopping in stores anytime soon, but I'd be lying if I said the change in lifestyle hasn't been wearing on me. I think part of this could be the fact that my mom's house isn't the one I grew up in, and the space where I'm working and sleeping wasn't furnished with long-term use in mind. What I'm getting at is that I'd like to get back towards finding my own place closer to the city within a half-hour's drive, but without feeling like I'd be leaving my mom behind, especially because my only other sibling lives several hours away.

We thought we were all friends when we moved in but I have since been proven wrong by their behavior. Since the beginning, the housemate's boyfriend has been coming over in spite of shelter in place, and since shelter in place lifted in CA, this boyfriend has basically gone back to socializing with friends. We tried to negotiate a limited bubble but he basically told us our anxieties aren't his problem and my housemate still goes off to parties with him.

Months of negotiations failed, and the setup of the house makes isolation from them next to impossible (shared bathroom, small kitchen, her WFH setup in the living room.)

I'm a graduate student, so even though I have good credit, if I apply alone my income does not meet the 2x rent cutoff. The rental market is competitive, and we have yet to find a place that allows cosigners that isn't student housing which he's not eligible for because he's not a student and we aren't married.

Made this new account due to privacy reasons but I will try to summarize the situation as briefly as possible.

My girlfriend and I live together. I work from home full time (WFH) and she works part time in a factory in Wisconsin. I am able to socially distance due to WFH but her workplace is a different story. Basically they have multiple rotating teams that work long shifts that alternate between days / nights. These teams perform tests on samples retrieved from the factory floor which requires interacting with factory workers on a regular basis.

The part that really sucks is that the factory workers and the team members my girlfriend work with for the most part do not wear masks. On top of this, there are people who have been in contact with family members who are confirmed COVID cases that still choose to come into work and put everyone else at risk. These people are sent home right away but I don't think they quarantine the full 14 days. Needless to say, management has been ineffective at requiring people to wear masks or handling potential cases.

Since she is full time she does not have benefits and I am concerned that she would end up with a lot of medical debt if she does catch COVID and has to go into intensive care.  Ultimately it is her decision on how to proceed with her employment but I have the following questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Should she quit outright and not show up anymore or would the smarter decision be to give a notice and work the full 2 weeks?** The concern is that if she quits outright that this would look very bad unless she was given the opportunity to explain this to the next employer.
2. I**s there any website / organization in Wisconsin that this could be reported to?**

I moved back in with my father during the summer to help care for my sister. Even though he's a trans/homophobic ass and I am a flaming pile of LGBT question marks, it didn't feel too isolating. Now she's gone to live with my mother, I've moved back in with roommates and the mental state has gone from relatively stable to dangerously damaged.

It should have been a great living arrangement since two of the roommates are close friends from university; one of which I'd lived with before. Spoiler alert : it has not been great. These friends are also sisters. I had a falling out with the one I'm closest with over some personal stuff but now she refuses to talk to me and both of them don't seem to give a damn about COVID. 

They have friends over frequently - though with a reassurance that it's the ""same people"" who just so happen to be health care workers and amazon shoppers. They're also convinced it's okay because any guests stay in the host's room and wear a mask in common spaces (which doesn't actually happen) as if the unmasking in the room is okay. I have pre-existing conditions and am terrified of being infected. My pops got laid off so i don't have health insurance right now (everything in my area is out of network with my mother's coverage - just paid 40$ for a flu shot)

I'm very lucky to have a WFH job that pays pretty well so I'm home most of the time, only going out for groceries and other essentials or just to be outside and away from everything. I take the bus because free transit pass, plus it feels safer than being in a tiny car with aforementioned roommates. Besides that, I really don't interact with people. My circle of friends is very small, even tighter now that it's down two. It's exhausting to hear people that you were close with kekeing just one room over while you spend all day playing video games in a desperate attempt to erase reality. 

Am I an asshole for being frustrated that these roommates / friends don't seem to realize that they were my one opportunity to interact with people and not be afraid?

1. Family #1 with a kid are WFH.

Family #2 where one of them was exposed, that whole family now has to strictly self-quarantine for two weeks from today, not even going out for essentials -- they're on delivery now. **Definite quarantine for Family #2.**

But what about Family #1 at this point?

"2020-09-18",1600470149,"Keep trying to make plans but no one seems interested","Hi reddit. This is my first post. I'm writing because I just needed a place to express my feeling of isolation with COVID.

I (25F) have a group of friends from work that are pretty tight, but we all work from home due to COVID. I try to make plans with them pretty much every weekend, but no one seems interested. I try to suggest different things (going out for some reasonably safe outdoor dining or drinks, a movie night, etc). They often glaze over it in the group text, people continue talking without acknowledging that I'd brought up trying to hang out. Most of them have kids and spouses so I know they're busy and try not to take it personally. I do get self conscious that it's just that they don't like me, but I really don't think that's it - they just are mostly introverts, we live a good bit apart, and are busy adults. I also don't think it's about COVID - because we do see each other sometimes and just from what I know about them, I know it's not that.

I only have 2 other friends (not part of that group) that I talk to often, and I try to link up with them but the same kind of thing happens where they're busy and our schedules don't line up.

I do see these friends occasionally, and I'm lucky to live with my S/O so I'm not totally alone. I also see my immediate family fairly often. And I started a new grad school program and am getting to know folks there, but of course its all online due to COVID so that kinda sucks socially too. I was particularly excited to start school because I was excited to make more friends and have more people to hang out and do things with.

I lost my best friend a couple of years ago (we had a huge falling out) and I feel like since then, I've been trying and trying to build up healthy, mutually reciprocated friendships, but it's so hard to make and see friends as an adult. COVID is making it all so hard because I'm just home all the time. I know I'm lucky compared to lots of people who live alone or have no family or friends, but I'm also trying to keep in mind that it's not the Grief Olympics and allow myself to feel sad about this.

What would you make of this? Has anyone else struggled with adult friendships like this? Am I expecting too much? I don't want to tell them I feel this way, I'd be embarrassed :/

TL;DR: I think my friends do genuinely like me, but they don't seem to want to hang out nearly as often as I would like and it makes me feel really rejected.

My office has us on a hybrid WFH model  3 days in office, 2 days remote. Only unvaccinated people are required to wear masks in the office at all times (we had to provide proof of vax cards), but I still mask when moving around the building. 

Work protocols encourage all digital meetings, but allow in-person conferences with social distancing. So far Ive been able to avoid any in-person meetings, except this one&

Im required to attend an off-site meeting with members of my office + members of a new agency partner.

"2020-11-26",1606371555,"How to reconcile living with a family member who is not as concerned","I'm having trouble coming to terms that my brother and I are on different wavelengths. I've (M22) known that he (M22) is very much on a different page than me from the beginning. However, he did magnificently well with staying home when things started in March. He really didn't do much from March through June I'd say. He continued to pretty much stay home, but now, within the past week, as COVID cases are rising exponentially in my area, he's been with 2 groups of people and going to the gym. I'm furious.

We live with our parents (M60, F56), both high risk, and my dad just had knee replacement surgery on Monday. We have all worn masks since the beginning, are good with quarantining, don't do anything unnecessary, etc. Now, I have severe OCD/health anxiety so much of these ""rules"" are because of me. Surprisingly, I tested positive 10/29 after my first social visit since March. You can read about it in a past post as that's a whole different story that completely boggles the mind. My risk for infection was incredibly low according to my doctor, and he didn't advise quarantine, nor did the CDC based on their guidelines, but I still did because my absolute worst fear was infecting my parents should I be sick. My mom is very good at understanding, but my dad...he just doesn't care. He follows the rules well but he doesn't care like my mom and I do. I'm thankful I decided to quarantine to be extra safe as I'm sure the outcome of my family's negative tests would've been different had I not. In fact, I still wear a mask and try to stay socially distant. My brother couldn't even wear a mask when he was in quarantine between my positive test and the results of his test negative test. 

My mom is extremely worried, but I think I worry about my dad more than he worries about himself. I told my mom my brother needs to wear a mask and do his best to quarantine after this little shindig. It was a big commotion about him going, very dramatic, but he ended up going because my parents (mostly my mom) don't want to have to deal with his shitty attitude. He did mention his mental health is suffering, which I do believe, but it's so hard for me to reconcile this because my mental health is not good ( I'm the only one in the family in therapy) but I'm also 100% more scared about my parents getting sick. But he also said he doesn't want therapy because the ""gym is his therapy"" omg but I digress. I totally believe COVID fatigue is a thing and that our mental healths are suffering from this experience. But I also think he's being incredibly selfish, and frankly, I don't want him around here if he's going to make the decision for us about who we get to be exposed to. There's been talk about him getting an apartment in the area for now (he has a job lined up in another city - he started work in August - but it's WFH until at least June). This would be the most ideal solution.

But basically, I know I can't control other people - but what can I do to ensure my parents don't get sick? My parents have been very careful - my mom more than my dad - and as I never would've forgiven myself if I had gotten them sick, I don't know how I could ever forgive him for getting them sick due to his selfish behavior. I just don't know what to do and I wish he cared at the level I care. Everything I say to him just goes in one ear and out the other. He even admitted he'd rather have COVID than still be stuck inside. I don't understand this mindset as having COVID - even with my own symptoms being basically nonexistent - was one of the most traumatizing and upsetting experiences. 

Sorry if this is a mess of writing. I had to vent, too. :(

"2020-03-07",1583544223,"Article: I have the coronavirus. So far, it hasnt been that bad for me.","It's from the Washington Post here:
https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/02/28/i-have-coronavirus-so-far-it-isnt-that-bad/

But in case of a paywall I thought I'd paste the text for you.



**I have the coronavirus. And it hasnt been that bad.**

I am in my late 60s, and the sickest Ive ever been was when I had bronchitis several years ago. That laid me out on my back for a few days. This has been much easier: no chills, no body aches. I breathe easily, and I dont have a stuffy nose. My chest feels tight, and I have coughing spells. If I were at home with similar symptoms, I probably would have gone to work as usual.

I caught the virus on the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that was quarantined outside Yokohama for 14 days, at the end of a 16-day cruise I took with my wife, Jeri. When I left the ship a couple of weeks ago, I felt fine. We checked our temperatures throughout our quarantine. Jeri and I got a swab test for the virus. Our temperatures were normal; theyd get the swab results back in 48 hours. Our test results had not arrived before we boarded buses for the airport, where two U.S. government planes waited for us.

As we took off from Tokyo, I had a bit of a cough, but I chalked it up to the dry air in the cabin. I felt pretty tired  but who wouldnt, in our situation? I dozed off.

When I woke up, I had a fever. I made my way to the back of the cargo plane, where the Air Force had set up a quarantine area cordoned off with sheets of plastic. They took my temperature. It was over 103 degrees. So I took a seat in the quarantine area and fell back asleep until we touched down in California, at Travis Air Force Base.

Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention came onto the plane and said that three of us who had been cordoned off would fly to Omaha (with our spouses, if they wanted to come along). The CDC had a quarantine location at the University of Nebraskas hospital. We arrived on Feb. 17, greeted by a fleet of ambulances and police cars. Officials put me on a stretcher and wheeled me into a van, which made for a very dramatic scene. I easily could have walked myself, despite my exhaustion.

On the hospital campus, they put me in a biocontainment unit. The space was sealed off, with two double-paned windows that looked out on the hallway, and a large, heavy, insulated door. Two cameras watched me at all times; a set of computer monitors were equipped with microphones, so that the medical staff and I could communicate with CDC officials at central command down the hall. The room had last been used for the Ebola outbreak in 2014.

A doctor and nurses reviewed my case with me and took a bunch of lab tests. They wore heavy-duty hazmat suits sealed with duct tape and equipped with motors that helped with air circulation. It looked like something out of The Andromeda Strain. When the test came back a few hours later, I wasnt surprised to learn that I had the coronavirus. Later, the Tokyo swab confirmed the result  I had caught the virus even before I left the ship.

It didnt scare me too badly. I knew my number was up. The way I saw it, I was going to get stuck in at least 14 more days of quarantine, even if I didnt get the virus. So many fellow passengers had come down with the illness, including one of my friends, that Id gotten somewhat used to the idea that I might catch it, too. My wife, however, tested negative and headed to quarantine at a separate facility a few blocks away. After those days being cooped up on the ship together, I think we both relished the alone time; we still could communicate through our phones.

During the first few days, the hospital staff hooked me up to an IV, mostly as a precaution, and used it to administer magnesium and potassium, just to make sure I had plenty of vitamins. Other than that, my treatment has consisted of what felt like gallons and gallons of Gatorade  and, when my fever rose just above 100 degrees, some ibuprofen. The nurses came to the room every four hours or so, to check my vitals, ask if I needed anything and to draw my blood. I got very good at unhooking all the monitors checking my oxygen level, blood pressure and heart rate so I could go to the bathroom or just pace around the room a little, to get my blood flowing. I never quite got the hang of hooking them back up without making a tangled mess. After 10 days, I moved out of biocontainment and into the same facility as Jeri. Now we can videochat from our separate quarantines, in neighboring rooms.

As of my most recent test, on Thursday, I am still testing positive for the virus. But by now, I dont require much medical care. The nurses check my temperature twice a day and draw my blood, because Ive agreed to participate in a clinical study to try to find a treatment for coronavirus. If I test negative three days in a row, then I get to leave.

The time has passed more quickly than I wouldve expected. With my laptop, I get as much work done as I can, remotely. I catch up with friends. I take walks around my room, trying to take a thousand more steps each day. I also watch the news. Its surreal to see everyone panic  news conferences, the stock market falling, school closures  about a disease I have. It does seem likely that coronavirus will spread in the United States, but it wont help anybody if we all panic. Its true that the disease seems much more likely to be fatal for older people and those in poor health. Im relatively fortunate: Im still younger than the most at-risk groups, and Im in good shape, giving me less cause for alarm. Others who contract the virus wont be as lucky. At least six Diamond Princess passengers have died from the disease, of around 705 passengers who caught it.

Still, coronavirus doesnt have to be a horrible calamity. Based on my experience, Id recommend that everyone get a good digital thermometer, just as a comfort tool, so they can reassure themselves if their noses start running.

If you told me when I left home in January that I wouldnt be back until March  that, instead, I would be confined for more than 24 days because Id catch a novel virus at the center of what could become a pandemic  that would have completely freaked me out. But now that its happening, Im just taking it one day at a time.","COVID19_support",37,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fenuog/article_i_have_the_coronavirus_so_far_it_hasnt/"

My dad was so worried about getting sick he only left the house to go to work and my mom only left to get groceries. My sisters and I were at home 24/7 till June when I had to go to my college apartment to work + do summer classes remotely in a place where I had my own room (I shared my room with 2 other sisters). After I left I came back home just in time for fathers day, celebrated with my dad...not knowing that would be the last time I saw him alive. I went back to my apartment not knowing my whole family would catch COVID that same week...from my dad who caught it at work...from a co-worker who went to the beach a week prior. My dad did everything he could to protect us. His job didn't allow him to work from home, but he took all the safety precautions we were told (mask, gloves, lots of hand sanitizer). I lost my dad to a virus people aren't taking seriously. It's so frustrating to see people treat this as a joke....especially where I'm from (south Florida). Everything is a reminder of what I've lost. Being stuck inside makes grieving so much more difficult. My mom and sisters have antibodies but since I never got sick (my test was negative) I don't have any. Because my dad was the only one who worked, my mom and I now have to expose ourselves to be able to support our family. I'm so mad at everything....I'm so mad at the world and I don't know how to cope. I don't know how to keep going through the fall semester, both because of what happened to my dad, and being in quarantine has taken such a toll on my mental health.

"2020-04-07",1586222538,"My 31 year old brother was given 2 more days to live. And the Doctor wants me family to make a difficult choice.. I can't bear it.","His ICU doctor has changed about 4 times now. This current doctor I've met before on a pharmacy rotation at one of the network hospitals almost 3  years ago. He's a hard military man who got out of active duty and now works in critical care. He was cold and unforgiving when I was a student, and when I talked to him today, he's about the same.

My older brother (I'm 26) went to the hospital March 25th with COVID like symptoms and then intubated the day after he was admitted with a fever of 102F. Everyday I asked the hospital staff information about his labs, his breathing progression, his kidneys, organs, medications, any information that would help me understand how he was progressing.

I could tell by the labs and his breathing that he really didn't improve much. It's been about 10 days and he's still on a ventilator. They now found blood in his endotracheal tube. The doctor told me that bleeding in patients is easy to treat if it's caused by cancer/tumors, or other external factors, but the fact that he's bleeding means he is bleeding in his lungs. The infection is getting more severe even with antibiotics for ventilator associated pneumonia.

So today he asked me...  to try and decide. I asked him how much time does my brother have left? He said give or take one or two days. I can't even leave my military base (in Oklahoma) right now to go back to my family (in Pennsylvania) because I still need permission from the General Commander.. My mom tested positive for COVID March 19th and she's technically still on quarantine with my dad who was negative.  My mom has been begging me not to come because she doesn't want to see me get sick and end up like my brother. But I told her that I need to come home, I don't think the hospital staff will let me see him but if he... passes... I want to see his body at least.

The doctor said we can either

1. continue to let him stay sedated... see if he can try to continue to fight his infections. He would need to significantly improve in a matter of a day or two, if he doesn't then he's probably going to... pass away... sedated, while trying to fight.
2. wake him up. say our last good byes.

I'm scared to have to make a decision. I talked to his boyfriend and he told me that my brother would want to keep fighting. I want him to fight too  but I know my mom wants to say bye, but we can't go into the hospital to say goodbye. It would have to be over video call... He would die alone in the hospital without anyone. he would be woken up after 10-14 days of being asleep and being suddenly told ""we can't save you. Say good bye forever."" I can't bear it. I'm falling apart at the seems. For anyone who's reading this thank you for reading it all. I would like for anyone to tell me if they had to make a hard decision like this before or if they lost anyone and what it was like. I've never lost a family member before... I am just totally lost. Thank you.

tldr; older brother,31 relatively healthy ended up on a ventilator for 10-12 days. doctor told my family either we let him keep fighting for 1-2 more days to see if he gets better, if not he will die regardless or we wake him up and say good bye remotely from phone call.

You may have experienced it in an overwhelming, unfamiliar situation or while intoxicated. It's the third most common mental health symptom after depression and anxiety. 

It's also thought to be a symptom of anxiety and a self defence mechanism of the mind to protect the individual from trauma, such as a car crash or childhood abuse. Many reported the world around them feeling unreal after 9/11 happened.

You may currently feel the world around you is dreamlike/unreal. You may suddenly feel like you're an outside observer of your body and its actions. You feel numb as the world around you changes instantly.

If you feel this way, please don't panic. It means you're obviously stressed, rightfully so, and your mind is trying to protect you as it tries to deal with the situation objectively. Reach out for professional help, even if it's done remotely. Find something, just one thing, that relaxes you and helps clear your mind like working out or journaling. 

Stay safe and keep busy.

I've been eyeing it for some time, and finally found one that fit the bill. I actually went through the process, got credit checked and approved, was ready to sign and seal. The night before, I started reflecting. What the hell am I doing? I HAVE a car. It's not perfect, but it does the job. I'm not even driving anywhere right now anyway. The furthest I've driven in the last 4 months was a town over. And the payments on this thing? Monstrous. 

I turned it down today. And I thought, I think the real reason I almost went on this deep dive for a shiny new car is because...I just wanted something to look forward to. Before all this went down, I had started my dream job as a teacher, and had a budding new relationship. I had dreams of growing closer with my girlfriend, doing my PhD, getting more involved in my department, maybe even moving closer to work and getting a place with my girlfriend. 

All that is gone now and 4 months later it really seems to be setting in. She left me shortly after it began, I can't really say I blame her. That's way too much to put on a new relationship. All my work went remote. I'm still getting sections to teach but going online is so different. I'm back living with my parents at 32 which I'm actually thankful for, without them and the dogs I think I would have gone crazy. But it's just tough. It's like all this crap has been wiped, like making progress in a video game and finding out you forgot to save. 

So, I don't know. I want to date, but I can't. (though I am going to attempt to meet with someone who agreed to join me for a socially distant walk on Sunday). I want to progress in my career but it's stalled. I want to move out, but money is sparse and I don't want to be completely alone.

I had covid in March. I have asthma but otherwise am healthy, and Im pretty young. Truth be told, I wouldnt have known I had it if I had not had a friend just come back from Italy that ended up sick. It started with difficulty breathing. Nothing awful, it was noticeable but I was still working out at home doing intense HIIT and was fine. Did need to use my rescue inhaler more, but it never felt scary or anything. Then a couple days later I developed a dry cough, not too bad just a bit annoying. That same day I developed a mild fever, just under 100°. It went away with ibuprofen and only lasted a day. I had some minor body aches that day and the next and then they went away. The cough cleared up after a week, the difficulty breathing continued for a few more weeks, but it never got worse or anything. I used a nebulizer and was fine, still continued my workouts at home. I have had colds that were far worse and messed me up for a longer period of time. I have noticed my allergies have been worse this summer, not sure if theres a relation or not. I tested negative 3 weeks after initial onset of symptoms, but that was the only subsequent test I had so I would likely have tested negative sooner than that if I had gotten one.  I had an unrelated lung scan a few weeks ago and my lungs are wonderful and clear, and the permanent damage they told me Id have after a nasty virus 3 years ago is completely gone. 

This isnt to say everyones experience will be like this, but I feel these stories need to be shared. We are constantly having the 30 year old dies after partying stories shoved down our throats, yet none from the loads of people who have recovered just fine, which are the vast majority. Moral of the story: be cautious, do what you feel you should to be safe, but know that typically people are not experiencing complications or even requiring healthcare for this.  I see a lot of replies on this sub that seem to encourage the panic and fear many are struggling with and I am hoping this helps.","COVID19_support",37,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hxs6ed/my_hopefully_reassuring_experience/"
"2020-12-26",1609003473,"Moving back home with your parents","Im a 30F and Ive always prided myself on being independent. With the pandemic getting worse, I couldnt stomach the idea of going through another lockdown during a Chicago winter by myself. I decided to move back home with my parents until my office reopens (earliest is April). I know for my mental health- its the right thing to do; having one sided conversations with your dog doesnt replace human contact and that Im incredibly privileged to have a family to go to and a job that lets me work remotely. But, I cant help feeling pathetic or like a failure. This isnt where I thought Id be at 30 especially as most of my friends are getting married or having babies.

"2020-03-14",1584148102,"If You Are Having Anxiety Over COVID-19, Consider Not Reading The News/News Subreddits for Awhile (An Option)","Many of us, myself included are here because we are terrified of the current Coronavirus situation. I will not downplay it, it is a scary situation to be sure,  and there is no certainty when things will go back to a semblance of normal.

That said, from personal experience if you are struggling it may be time to step away from the news cycle.

It will be hard, especially if you are hanging on every word right now. You want to be informed, know whats going on, be prepared for the future! Hell maybe a new piece of information about death rates/illness length/ect will appear. The issue is that at this point, you **ALREADY KNOW** almost everything you need to know about whats going on, but you are still exposing yourself to your stressor.

We all know the media runs on clicks, and boy are they mining them hard now. Think about this. How likely are you to click a link with a scary title? Scrolling through a feed, which are you more likely to click, ""A Timetable to Recovery from COVID-19"" or ""How Will the World Recover From the Untold Damage from Coronavirus"" (I suck at making up headlines, but hopefully you get the point)? Hell there has been an article running amok today about Lung Scarring with a sensationalist headline like ""Why You Will Never Be the Same if You Get Coronavirus"". If you see that in passing it will scare the SHIT out of you, but only if you really read it, and it's source will you discover it's based on research with a sample size of 20 of only the worst cases (and no concessions on if you may heal).

Another big offender is the reddit community. For example /r/coronavirus now has almost A MILLION users (at the time of writing). With a group that big there is almost no filter on what a user can spew. I have seen people making claims about shit like ""My brother works for a finance company and they said we will need to switch to a gold economy after this"", ""10 million deaths is a gross and negligent underestimate, it will be 25 million"", and people literally claiming it's the end of humanity unironically. I have seen so many people make claims that world renown researchers and scientist are WRONG and they are RIGHT it makes my head spin.

The other issue with these communities is that ANYTHING remotely positive, or even mildly optimistic is immediately stamped out. If you post an article about how a very credentialed researcher thinks it may be ever so slightly less bad than ""we are fucked"" you will get called dangerous and downvoted out of existence. Some of these people do truly believe the this is the end, others are trolling, some are fantasizing, and others get off on the fear. There is almost no positivity allowed on many of these communities. If you find yourself having anxiety over Corona these are not places you should frequent

No amount of reading about bad things happening around the world is going to help you if you are already doing what is being asked of you as a citizen. If you are conforming to what the WHO/CDC ect are asking you to do there is nothing to gain by reading about horrible things happening elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

**So What Am I Proposing**

If you find yourself struggling with anxiety over corona, or the news it is time to lower your exposure to it.

\-Do what you need to be doing right now (stocking a few weeks of food/hygiene products/medicines,practicing social distancing whenever possible, washing your hands, coughing/sneezing into your elbow, keeping an eye on symptoms, ect). Look for CDC/WHO guidelines on what you should be doing.

\-Wait and read any updates that come from Government/World Agencies (The CDC, WHO, The President, ect)

\-Follow your country/state/local authorities on twitter, or find their website that official updates are released on and follow it.

\-Otherwise do whatever you need to survive, remembering to try and eat well, sleep well, and try and exercise.

\-If you feel up to it check in on the news, but remember to have a discerning eye for sensationalism and bad articles

I work for a call center I.T. company. We do IT remotely for over 500 companies in the State of NJ where the COVID-19 numbers have been one of the highest in the country.

During Phase 1 (from March through May), we had a perfect work from home infrastructure and our technicians thrived. Our ticket counts were the lowest they have been in years, all while working from home. All our clients were paying us and our owner still qualified for government assistance for over $5 Million that I'm pretty sure he doesn't have to repay. We are NOT hurting financially at all.

In New Jersey, Phases 1, 2 &amp; 3 all require that office workers work from home if at all possible. While still in phase 1, my employer started to mandate that all employees come in the office (even though we had a perfect work from home infrastructure in place).

This wasn't quite what bothered me though. What really bothered me was the fact that when you got to the office, there wasn't any safety precautions put into effect. All the employees were walking around without masks. Anyone that didn't have a mask was called out by our bosses and made to look childish and incompetent. They attacked us mentally and made snarky remarks in front of all our co-workers. They essentially demean you until you give up and remove your mask. They also called large meetings into a small conference room where employees were forced to stand shoulder to shoulder without any PPE.

I've worked here for over 5 years and I'm yet to experience this type of toxic work environment up until this point. It almost feels as if they are trying to push their political agenda on you.

I'm not sure what to do. They are still in fact paying the bills, but at what cost? Should I just shut-up and color, or should I stand my ground? If I choose the latter, what are my options?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm quite lost right now and mentally exhausted over this matter.

"2020-10-26",1603740622,"I'm an introvert but lately social distancing is getting to me","So, before covid I often found myself thinking that I just want the world to stop for a moment to catch my breath. Be careful what you wish for, I guess. I work with risk groups and when the virus reached my country I had daily panic attacks for a week. It felt as if I was drowning because I had to make up protocols we'd never need before, keep everyone healthy and worry about getting masks etc. I survived the spring thanks to a mindfulnees app and a chance to do some of the work remotely.

Whenever I felt low I just went outside and the sun took care of the rest. Now it's october. Knowing that there's 6 months of darkness (I live in northern Europe) and mud waiting ahead, is crushing me. I hope we have snow this year.   
I recently had a health scare myself and am still not over the trauma of it. This made me realize that even though I've enjoyed being single and independent for the last couple of years, I'm starting to get the appeal of coming home to someone. Most of my family and many of my friends live in another city, which wasn't a problem up until now. I feel so utterly alone and crushed by anxiety.

I'm an introvert but... I just want to see my friends and family whenever I want to. I want to go to a party and not worry about if I get sick or get someone else sick. I want to meet new people. I want to hug.

I was starting to finally get new hobbies like wall climbing and going to the gym, but then my country was put on lockdown where I can't go anywhere. And I guess not being able to do my outdoor hobbies is reminding how boring my life really is.

"2021-02-27",1614448371,"My life is a total mess and I don't know what to do","I'm writing this, probably long, post out of boredom and from the feeling that I wan't to get things out of my chest. Maybe this introspection will help me understand my situation, or maybe I'm just looking for some mental stimulus on a saturday evening.

My background is, that I'm turning 27. Pre-covid I was working as a freelancing technician in culture/events, mostly for bands. Tours and such. My career was decent and I felt like I was going to places, however I don't have any education related to my former job or anything else (I had a bit hard time growing up and some family issues etc), I got to where I was simply by working hard, learning by myself and connecting with people.

As you can probably imagine, in my line of business everything was cancelled in march of last year. I had some small gigs here and there during 2020, but mostly I've been living off social security and with some help from my dad. I also had good savings going in to pandemic so that has been helpful also.

I should have looked for a new job, but since I don't have any education or special skills outside my former work, it didnt feel that simple. Also, nobody knew what was going to happen during the last year. I was always having some work opportunities in the coming months, so I didn't just want to quit my old job. Naturally everything got always cancelled. Sometimes in weeks of notice, sometimes of just in days. It was really hard to plan anything. During the summer my country was in a really good situation and everybody was saying that there will be no second wave and this will be over soon.

Another reason why I didn't just go and find a job, is that I'm starting a private coding/IT school this may. I was supposed to start it last may. Then it got postponed without a starting date (due to covid). Then it was supposed to start last september. I was very eager to start studying. Then it got postponed again due to covid situation getting worse (2 weeks before the launch...). They were speaking of developing remote possibilities ASAP. Then they told us it won't start in 2020. Now it's supposed to start in may. That's the only thing I'm looking forward to at the moment.

I live alone. I broke up with my girlfriend in 2019. My job was my whole life and dating in this pandemic seems kinda hard. I tried some tindering during the summer of 2020, but it didn't really go anywhere. I met some nice people, but I guess I was a bit too desperate for my life to change. My self-esteem has always been low, but this pandemic has made it much worse. I mean, who would date a 27 year old jobless outcast who has alianated from society? Somebody who hasnt been romantically with anyone in years? I guess my time will come, but I feel so left behind when I compare myself to my friends for example.

Currently my days are spent playing video games, which I really don't even enjoy, but they are a good way of escapism from all the self-pity and loathe. My sleep schedule is obviously really fucked up due to having no reason to wake up in the morning. It's a vicious cycle which keeps on looping. I absolutely hate myself for spending a year of doing nothing productive at all. Some days I get a brief moment of inspiration and try to do something smart, but those moments don't really last and I'm too tired to focus in anything. It's absurd what depression does to you. I used to be higly fucntioning and motivated being with a purpose in life, but now I'm too tired to make food or to clean my apartment. Or to brush my teeth. Or to shower everyday. I guess I'm now addicted to games/internet and it doesn't help the situation.

I started therapy last autumn. It's currently on pause due to my therapist got some family addition, but honestly, even though my therapist seems like a really wise and empathetic person, seeing him once a week hasn't really improved the quality of my life. I guess it's better than nothing. People usually suggest finding a new one, but it took me months to get to this point with my current one, that we both know each other and he understands my situation and so on... I just don't understand, that how does it help me when I go there once a week telling him how I ""feel"". There's nothing happening in my life. Nothing to tell about. Everything is as fucked up as it was last week. I've told him on couple of occasions, that sometimes I wish I was dead. He says it's normal to fantasize about that in my situation. Like it's somekind of fantasy of being free from all the negative thoughts and the pressure society puts on us. I don't know what to think of that. It's not that I'm going to do something to myself, it's just that I'd rather think of something else than why and how should I die.

I don't know how, when and why, but I've also alianated from my friends. I haven't really seen anyone after last december. My country is heading to bigger lockdowns during the next weeks, so that's a thing which is unlikely going to change. Nobody really texts me or anything. I've always been a bit introvert and maintaining relationships has been a bit hard for me, but this is a whole new era. I wonder what people think of me. Have I become too boring? Have I always been? Do I complain about my situation too much? I don't know. I understand that my effort is also needed in friendships and maybe I should be the one initiating the conversations or get togethers, but currently I don't have the powers to do that, and even if I would, I feel that I have nothing to tell to anyone. Except things which probably would make them pity me, and I hate being the pityed one whos ""going through some hard things"". I don't know where that is coming from. It's not that I have a problem with people telling me about their hardships at all. I don't know. My thoughts seem a bit irrational now. No doubt this hermit lifestyle of mine is making me a bit delusional. What I'm trying to say, that being this lonely makes me sad and I feel like I'm meaningless. I don't really like myself. And I hate myself for saying that. It's my responsibility to fix my life, but I'm only complaining and drowning in self-loathe and pity instead of actually trying to do something. It's hard to explain.

(Throwaway acct for reasons.)

**Backstory**: (skip ahead to the question if you don't care)

I'm a 41yo male in the US (Michigan). I've never been especially healthy. Asthma, childhood lung damage, ADHD, overweight (5'6, 200lbs), etc.- I was paranoid about Covid because I was a walking pre-existing condition. I've been a virtual shut-in for the past year, leaving the house less than a dozen times since March 2020 and working from home since then. To top it off, I found out I'm diabetic in December. I was excited when got my first pfizer shot on Tuesday, March 30th.

On Tuesday, April 6th (1 week later), I started feeling unwell- exhaustion, brainfog, extreme stomach and intestinal cramps, and (humorously) extreme flatulence and burping. I mean EXTREME flatulence and burping. By Thursday, April 8th (2 days later) my wife took me to Urgent Care at 10am. Doc called it Gastroenteritis, suggested Tagamet, and said it could be caused by Covid. My wife and I laughed. They gave me a quick test which came back negative, and the PCR test that would be back in a few days.

The results came back Monday April 12th- I was positive for Covid. They estimated that I was exposed on April 1st or 2nd. So I checked Google Timeline. I confirmed that I hadn't left the house between 3/30 and 4/4 other than a short walk when it was nice out. I wore a mask and kept my distance from the few people I saw.

I was told I would be non-contagious on April 16th. I slept by myself, ate by myself, and lived in my office away from the rest of the family. On April 19th, my wife and kids took PCR tests to determine if they had contracted it or were asymptomatic carriers. All three were negative.

We did everything right. Kids have done virtual learning all year, we used Shipt for grocery deliveries, and only my wife went out when it couldn't be avoided. We have no idea how I got it.

It's been a week since the gas and cramps ended (the Tagamet was magic), but the exhaustion and brainfog stayed. From April 6th until April 17th, I slept 12-18 hours a day. I'm still sleeping 12 hours a day, and can barely stay awake for 4-6 hours at a time during the day without taking a 2+ hour nap. It's worth noting that I'm on Vyvanse (an amphetamine) for ADHD and drink a french press of coffee a day and I'm still exhausted, plus I now have the attention span and focus of a goldfish.

I started a new job in Feb 2020, and began working remote full time one month later. I work in IT and rely on my 20 years of experience and attention to detail to excel at my job. I've always tried hard to do my job well and still keep my work/life balance. I've almost always get positive reviews from my managers (despite my imposter syndrome) and get positive feedback from my colleagues.

While my boss and employer in general have been understanding, I missed a virtual-meeting today (11am) because I laid down (10:30am) and fell asleep until 1pm (when a reminder for another meeting went off on my phone). I had woken up at 7:30am and had over 8 hours of sleep last night. I spoke with my boss who has been super understanding and tells me my health is my #1 priority, but I fear that at some point I'll just become a drag on the team. I can't be effective like this.

To top it off, my team has lost 2 team members in the past month and another two are going to be going on paternity leave this month. That will leave us with 4 people besides me. My team is terribly understaffed now, and they are going to need me to step up as one of the ""Senior"" guys. I don't think I can.

(TL;DR I got covid and am now constantly exhausted w/ brainfog)

**Question**

Given my career (knowledge worker), my exhaustion, and my brain fog, how can continue working like this? If this is my ""long covid,"" how can I do my job in a way that is fair to my team? While I generally don't feel bad for corporations, I do feel that I'm not keeping up my end of the bargain.

If I was to suddenly lose my job, I don't think I'd make it through an interview, which is a problem because I'm the primary breadwinner and my wife has been a stay-at-home mom for the past 14 years. When I eventually have to go back to the office (either this job or the next), should I bring a sleeping bag and pillow? make a pillow fort under my desk? How do I work when I can't stay awake for a work day?

I'm sure I'm not the only one going through something like this. Realistically, what are my options? If this is my new normal, should I be looking into disability? It feels absurd, but it also feels accurate.

Im working remotely and my company has been awesome with keeping all full-time employees on the payroll throughout Covid.

"2020-10-24",1603504890,"Just need some support right now","I \[21F\] am really struggling to progress with my life and find reasons to stay afloat in the midst of this COVID-19 mess. I'm in my 4th year of college (though I'm not expected to graduate until 2022, thankfully), and the new ""hybrid"" (aka almost completely online) mode of classes at my school has been really problematic overall this semester. I had to drop 2 classes out of the 4 classes I originally planned to complete this semester for COVID-related reasons -- one class had technical issues every day with making lectures accessible for those attending remotely, and the other was taught by a demanding professor who became defensive and regularly made threats (e.g. making the final exam worth 90%+ of our overall class grade, making us use Honorlock instead of open notes to complete all exams, shortening ""open-note"" quick quizzes that were already only 10 minutes long to reduce ability to look at notes, etc.) in response to us simply asking questions about the format of the course -- and it's so difficult to stay motivated in the 2 classes I am taking due to how depressing everything is right now, in addition to how depressing things already were right before COVID due to my grandfather's passing near the end of 2019 and the increased anxiety and depression I experienced immediately following his passing.

I'm also autistic (was diagnosed at the age of 4), and partly as a result of this, I have struggled to make friends in the traditional sense my whole life. I very frequently had no friends I could socialize with during my growing-up years (despite my own efforts to take initiative and reach out to people), and even when I did have a few good friends, I've nearly always had to be the one to reach out in order for socialization to be possible. Even then, nearly all of them eventually left in favor of ""better"" friends (I feel very much like a back-up/convenience friend as a result of this), and it has resulted in me feeling very unwanted, unloved, and lonely with abandonment issues. These feelings have only gotten worse during the pandemic, especially since it's even harder to talk with others right now and I constantly hear about how much harder it apparently is to make friends after college.

Another weird thing I've noticed with my social life is that older adults (family friends, former teachers, other older adults in the community) tend to gravitate toward me (and vise versa) much more easily than to many same-age people I know, whereas I really struggle with making and especially maintaining friendships with people near my age. I don't really know why this is the case, though people have said I am mature for my age and an ""old soul"", so maybe this contributes? Either way, it feels almost wrong/taboo that this is the case (though I have enjoyed the friendships I've made with older adults), and I wish it was easier to make friends near my age (in addition to the older adult friendships I've maintained), in part due to a fear of being alone after the older adults I know pass on.

I also have a difficult time dealing with even minor uncertainty/changes of plan/spontaneity, partly as a result of being autistic, so the constant feelings of major uncertainty resulting from the pandemic have resulted in my brain being in a constant haywire mode. (When will I be able to see higher-risk family and friends again? I, fortunately, got an internship offer recently for Summer 2021 -- what will the pandemic situation look like then? When will all of this end? 2021? 2022? Never?! Nobody even knows the stages of getting out of this pandemic -- though it doesn't help that our administration in the U.S. is a joke -- let alone when it will end, if ever.)

On top of all of that, I also have a semi-abusive home situation (my mother has been incredibly supportive of me my whole life, but she gets angry and starts yelling at my dad and/or me very easily as a result of a dysfunctional childhood, and I sometimes don't even know what I did that caused her to start yelling at me until after the yelling starts) that made things worse when I was forced to leave my college campus and return home to my parents in March. Staying at home, 24/7 (my parents are working from home now because of COVID), for 5 months with a mother whose tendency to scold, argue, and/or yell over every little thing worsened (understandably) because of pandemic-induced stress (both my parents take the pandemic very seriously, thankfully, she was just stressed about the situation and other people not taking it seriously) was not a pleasant experience, and I'm a little nervous about going back to my parents' house for a month and a half during Thanksgiving Break due to not knowing how to effectively handle these situations (I've lost count of the number of times I had to excuse myself from dinner before dinner even started because my parents would not stop arguing and/or yelling at each other at the table, and at one point this summer my mom started full-on screaming and slamming doors at my dad and me for the first time since she abused alcohol during my middle school years).

I'm typically a very ambitious person who cares about doing the best I can in what I do to progress toward long-term goals in life, but at this point, I don't really have any dreams I'm excited about at all, and I'm honestly just trying to get through the semester and make sure I'm actually still alive at the end of it all (I have had suicidal thoughts on and off since May, and while I am currently in counseling for anxiety and depression, it hasn't been enough to overcome the overwhelming dark thoughts I experience so frequently), and even then, it's hard to have any hope anymore with the current pandemic and with climate change looming just around the corner.","COVID19_support",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jh0olj/just_need_some_support_right_now/"
"2021-02-01",1612196480,"I think I ""found"" myself during this pandemic","Anyone have experiences that have totally changed their outlook since the start of the pandemic? Here, I'll go first:

The pandemic made me realize my employer has no allegiance to me and from a high level, does not care about me. I've been with the same research hospital for 10 years. My boss is excellent but turns out she is powerless in determining my workload and the direction of our team. One person had a personal meltdown at the beginning and refused to come to work, we got no help. Two people quit over the fall and we received zero help, zero allowance to slow down work while we hired replacements. All the existing staff is doing the work of at least 2 people and she has no power to persuade upper management for more help if they don't feel like giving it. The old me would give 110% every day for the sake of ""the department"" - but I just don't have it in me these days. My husband has had it even worse - his employer has given zero covid-guidelines, doesn't enforce masks or anything of the sort. Guys pick up covid, and have to sit out, they just toss another guy in w/o investigating the source or requiring testing to come back. We've been terrified that he'll pick it up from work. 

It also made me realize that I directed a lot of my life based on my daily interactions with other adults. Other adults have children, so therefore I should, too. Have done a lot of soul-searching over the last year, and I just don't think I want kids. It's not something I think will bring me joy. Will I feel left out of a lot of adult female conversations? Sure, but I should have known for myself earlier why my eyes glaze over whenever my coworkers talk about their kids. Now that I'm untethered from that everyday, I realize that I just never wanted it for myself. Same for my personal interests. I decorated my home like a proper ""adult"" based on how visitors would think of my home, but now that no one is coming around to judge it, I want to re-decorate my house with things that I like. I also like anime and comics and video games again without feeling ashamed, because there isn't anyone around TO shame me. I got super into gardening and homesteading and living a more sustainable life. I want to disconnect from the American consumer culture and live a simpler life. All my tattoos are in hidden places for the sake of looking ""professional"" for when I went to my big girl job. Now that everything is remote, and remote work is here to stay, I feel more inclined to get those visible tattoos I've always wanted. Other people at work have them, but for some reason I didn't allow myself to be included in that group of people.

Life used to be go, go, go all the time. Working in the city M-F, upwards of 50/60+ hours a week and being too exhausted to do anything of personal substance on the weekends. My husband and I have done a lot of soul-searching the last year or so, and realized that we are really just done with the rat race. We will work hard and pay our bills like we always do, but we don't want to kill ourselves for our employer anymore, or let ""society"" dictate how we live our lives. We put ""us"" aside for so long to do the things society said we were ""supposed"" to do, and want to take that time back and then some.

"2020-08-08",1596907553,"High risk, living with a plague rat","I live in the USA, in a city which is currently a COVID hot spot.

I rent the basement of a friend's house. I have various physical glitches that make me high-risk, including asthma. Colds usually make my asthma flare up; the flu once put me in the hospital. Therefore, high-risk.

My friend is currently upstairs having a get-together with some ""friends from high school"", including several children. Nobody is wearing a mask. They're all indoors. He hasn't even opened the windows.

Yesterday, when he went to work, I noticed both his masks were still on the kitchen table. He has repeatedly not been wearing a mask to work or in public. This bothers me because he is young and healthy and likely to get an asymptomatic case and spread it when he goes to work--a job which involves repeatedly going into people's homes.

He's been having D&amp;D games in the living room. I asked the group to please have them online, but they won't. He only sets up a web cam so I can participate remotely from the basement. 

To make this worse, I am disabled and don't drive; so he is the only transportation I have if I don't want to use a taxi. With his behavior getting more and more careless as the pandemic gets worse and worse, I feel like I simply can't risk letting him drive me anywhere. Luckily, I grow some of my own food in the garden out back.

I'm so tired of him being so absolutely careless. He seems to think that he's going to get COVID no matter what happens, so he might as well stop taking precautions. He doesn't understand that as a a young, healthy person, he could become a disease vector and spread COVID to everyone whose house he enters during the course of his job, everyone who comes into our house--and very likely to me, thorough the air conditioning system which we share. 

I was hoping that I wouldn't have to isolate myself completely because he would be careful enough that I could consider him part of my household. But it's becoming increasingly clear to me that I am going to have to isolate myself from him, too.

I need to lay down the law: He is not to come downstairs. I can't take rides from him anymore; I need to get my groceries delivered. I feel like I should quit that D&amp;D game, too, because if I participate, I'm enabling these social gatherings which are entirely too risky.

I thought my friend was a kind person. He has always helped me in the past, and has always helped other people. But it seems now that his willingness to help stops when it inconveniences him.

I stopped volunteering at the library when the pandemic hit--the library is my favorite place in the whole world. I've made over a thousand cloth masks for my neighbors. My friend has even donated money for supplies for those masks--but he's got a steady job and he's got money to spare, if his patronage of restaurants and his high-end electronics are any indication. It seems that when it comes to going out of his way, he no longer wants to help other people. He doesn't have the patience or the self-control to wait this out, to be careful, to avoid becoming a COVID vector.

I worry that he thinks I'm a coward, that I'm paranoid. But that's not the way it is. This is a worldwide pandemic, it's killing off our elders. My grandmother just died two weeks ago, alone in her nursing home because of this pandemic, and I couldn't even go to her funeral! This is real, and he doesn't seem to understand it.

They had re-opened our location on a reservation basis only a few months ago. No one really came back. It was just me and a couple other people that would show up occasionally.

Just got the email today they've decided to close the building and go 100% remote.

I'm super thankful I have this job, but we used to have so much damn fun in the office. We worked hard but also had a TON of fun, days were full of laughter and smiles. We helped each other with our work and I truly felt purpose in my life helping the people I loved and having fun doing it. Now that's all gone. Now it's occasional IM chats but mostly silence.

"2022-02-20",1645367838,"Father critically ill in ICU, 5th day on the vent","What can I say? This is easily the most ruthless, cruel and devastating period of my life. My dear father, my best friend, relentlessly being taken away from me.

I know the odds are stacked against, nevertheless, I try my best to remain positive and today I have completed my 3rd day in a row of being alongside him in the ICU, just shouting at him to remain strong, that he is getting better, that well get through this and be more united and stronger than ever, saying that I love him and we need him, caressing his hand and hair.

Problem is when I crawl home and obsessively research ways to save him, whether its drugs or switching hospitals or whatever it is or I try to cling on to success stories that can give me some hope to carry on but they seem so few.

To add some context, my dad is 64, he is for the most part healthy, always had healthy habits, other than working too much and drinking some wine and his weight is within normal range. The problem is that roughly a year ago, his blood tests started to come back weird, with a very persistent anemia and off the charts white blood cell counts, especially monocytosis& some myelocytes and blasts were also detected in his peripheral blood.

Several tests after including bone marrow biopsies, myelograms and so on, the hematologists could tell his bone marrow was malfunctioning but couldnt absolutely diagnose him with CMML,perhaps because he wouldnt tick all the symptoms. Ive gone through as many documents my dad held about it and they always say CMML but under study. It is just very suspicious and infuriating why that doctor took so long to diagnose and procure him the best treatment. Perhaps he couldve already at least made some progress. 

In the meantime with this pandemic going on I told my dad countless times that not getting the vaccine was too risky, I even begged him to go and that I would accompany him if he was too scared about having an allergic reaction. I also advised him to avoid going out as much as possible and work remotely. Well he didnt listen but somehow we all managed to dodge this virus for nearly 2 years now.

With Omicron being prevalent now and the media being more optimistic he got a little too confident maybe and decided to take his chances with the virus. His lifestyle consisted in driving around a lot due to professional reasons and his girlfriend living far.

Early February he went to his girlfriends parents house for some sort of family gathering and now here we are with my dad in an induced coma since the morning of the 16th, on a vent and pneumonia on both lungs (50% compromised, dont know if that has changed though).

Docs say he is responding more or less well in terms of combatting the covid and the bacterial infection that had taken over his lungs but this whole doubt in regards to his leukaemia type is really not helping in terms of treatment and his organs are starting to struggle. I have been told they needed to stimulate his heart with some drug which they didnt disclose and his kidneys are struggling too but no dialysis is necessary yet.

I was with my father and I could see what drugs were being given through the automatic syringe pumps. Fentanyl, antibiotic, furosemide, lipids, noradrenaline are the ones I recall. 

What makes me kinda optimistic is that his vitals look good on the monitor and the vent is currently with a peep of 10 compared to the first time I saw him when it was at 12-15, oxygen concentration at 50% compared to former 80% and respiratory rate is at 22. 

He is also no longer prone at least since the 17th February. What does everyone think? Ill keep this thread as a journal. If anyone could help me I would be so thankful from the bottom of my heart. Because my dad has suspected CMML it is hard to find information regarding covid patients with this underlying issue.","COVID19_support",25,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/sx2le4/father_critically_ill_in_icu_5th_day_on_the_vent/"

After a while I came back home in order to save money. I also started seeing a life coach, but the realizations have not been easy. Now I'm almost 30, losing interest in my friends, and losing interest in any goal that isn't ""make more money.""

I wanted to learn musical instruments to be in a band. I love music and shows, but originally it was to get invited to parties and feel like a ""somebody"" outside my boring 9-to-5. I'm not bad, but I'm too nervous/indifferent to network and meet other musicians. I wanted to be a writer, mainly for the same reason, and I do write, but the frequency and quality of my work is far from a person that churns out book after book. And many of my best friends are either people I don't like to spend time around anymore or people that have moved far away. I'm lucky if I can see or hear from them 1-2 days a year. Those days are my high points and the rest of the year feels wasted. It shouldn't be that way.

Last summer seemed easier, more optimistic, because we had gotten vaccines and I was really happy to go out again. Then omicron hit, and the subsequent variants, and my workplace has moved us to full remote which killed my main social outlet. I'm not sure what I want to do anymore. My 20s were driven by a feeling that I was never fun or interesting or talented enough. And I don't know if I want to keep repeating the same mistakes, but trying new things while also realizing I might always be motivated by ego is scary.

I need self-acceptance. But I'm afraid self-acceptance means ""deep down I should accept being the lazy, scared, introvert I was when I was 10,"" and stop trying to be anything else. If I really wanted to be around people or in a band, I would have done it by now.""

I went to a food festival in the city with my friend last week. I felt so damn indifferent to it all. Like I wasn't able to enjoy it, like it wasn't the real world. Just an afternoon in some bizarre spectacle. I feel myself approaching total nihilism.

"2020-08-26",1598464265,"I hate absolutely everything right now, and I don't understand why people assume 2021 will bring change for the better","I'm seeing a therapist, but the depression I am feeling right now overwhelms me.

At the beginning of the pandemic (March/April/beginning of May), my whole company worked remotely from home. As the situation in my country more or less stabilized, we were informed that if we give notice to HR ahead (for them to arrange safe working conditions), we can starting coming back to the office (but it was voluntary).

I was thrilled, because I was going crazy at home. I arranged with my manager that I will work some days of the week in the office, and some from home, to kinda ease myself in. I thought I will feel better once I go back to familiar routine (normal day activities, wearing make-up and nice clothes, just generally not being stuck at home), but... I was wrong.

PRACTICALLY NO ONE ELSE came back to the office. Everyone is just chilling at home, all pleased that they don't have to commute. I don't know how can they stand it for so many months. So instead of feeling better, I feel even worse, because now that I'm going to a weirdly empty office, I feel even more isolated ironically.

I miss office parties and integration outings, that we used to have. I miss talking to people. I miss hugging my mom (she works in medical field so we have little contact in order not to endanger each other). I miss going out to a bar, or just casually shopping. I don't do... anything... right now. Nothing. I don't see people, I don't go places. And this situation is not changing, not getting better. The virus is not going away. Now soon, kids are about to go back to school, and that + upcoming autumn/winter season... well, I have bad feeling about it. I'm scared it will get worse.

At the same time, I see that various events (e.g. concerts, conventions), are being moved to 2021. Why... do people assume it will get better just because we switch a page in the calendar? People are being idiots, not wearing masks, not ""believing"" in the virus (oh my God...), clearly it's not getting anywhere near the end, so idk why everyone seems to think as soon as this year ends it will just get better.

Not having anything else to do, I really invested myself in my work (i also got a promotion in April, so I consider myself very lucky, in those unstable times, which only makes me more dedicated). And recently, I had a couple of days when I felt unwell, and panicked a bit that I might be getting sick. My first thoughts? That I will let my co-workers down, that I won't fulfill my duties. Logically it seems to me that I should worry about myself, my safety and health, but all I can think of is that if I got sick, I would have remorse regarding letting my job down. It's insane.

I hate everything that is happening now, and everything that I'm feeling. My year's resolution was to lose weight, but now I don't even care, what's the point? No point doing anything anymore.

But I guess it describes well what's been triggering my anxiety in the last months... In any case, I need help to see some light at the end of the tunnel, but I guess I also need to vent.  


I just turned 30. I finished graduate school last January and 2020 was going to be the year in which I would finally travel the world. I grew up in a poor country so it took me years to 'catch up', build some sort of life in a developed country, and work on my career, and I've spent most of my 20s doing exactly that. I had prepared for this trip for years: I saved money, I made countless plans of where to stay, what to see, I fought very hard for a remote job which I could maintain on the road. Corona came a few months before my departure date, and I found myself stuck in a country separated from my family (who live in one of the most affect countries at the moment) and my significant other (who lives in a country that closed all borders for the foreseeable future). As I planned to leave this country and most of my family/friends live abroad anyway, I haven't really developed a local social circle and I've basically met only two people since the beginning of the lockdown. I was very dependent on traveling for my mental wellbeing, and I just feel that the ""new normal"" restrictions, mostly social distancing and travel bans, took away every nice thing I had in life...

&amp;#x200B;

In the first months, I kept telling myself that I needed to hold on just a bit longer and some solution would be found. If not a solution, at least some temporary workaround. I did everything the local government asked: masks, no unnecessary trips, no large gatherings, social distancing, and so on. Now, however, I believe the 'just a bit longer' has become 'a few years', and some times I see no reason to keep going. I don't want to live in a socially distanced world, or in a world in which I can't see my loved ones again. I hate zoom and texting, and it makes me angry when people imply that those will be the main tools to keep in touch with loved ones forever. I guess I should clarify that by forever I mean for many years, as in 5 to 10. I've been having anxiety attacks every time I think I might not fly, see my loved ones, or go to a live concert again until I am almost 40 and my youth is behind me. For example, if I am not allowed to see my significant other in many years, the relationship is essentially already over. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this sounds overly exaggerated, as many people say the situation MUST improve somehow. But I simply don't see how, as governments and the media keep pushing for this ""new normal"" to be in place forever, and some people even accept it as some inevitable future. For example, large events without movement restrictions (like music festivals) can never again be allowed according to some governments or the WHO, even after a vaccine is found, as it is basically impossible to know if some participant is infected and might become a super spreader. International flights face a similar fate: no country will be willing to accept infected people after hurting their economies so much with lockdowns, so costly 14-day quarantines might become essential part of intercontinental travel and cheap travel/backpacking will be a thing of the past. All these thoughts make me think that there's really no point in social distancing anymore, as I am much more afraid of isolation than covid and I'm basically hopeless. I've become more supportive of people breaking the rules to have ""illegal"" parties, as there might be nothing else to lose anyway. On top of that, I see some of the alternatives for previous normal activities, like the drive-in concerts, and I don't know if I find them ridiculous or depressing.

Sorry if this sounds too pessimistic or if I come across as aggressive, this is not my intention. Does anybody have similar feelings or is in a similar situation? If so, what has worked for you so far? I was fine with putting my life on hold for a few months, but when it seems that I will lose my best remaining years away from the people and experiences that make life worth living, I really feel I have nothing else left to lose.

Does anyone else feel this way? Just like youre living in a fog and nothing makes sense or is real life?

Im not even sure its as black-and-white as regretting coming here, because I was also going absolutely crazy in New York. Its more just a serious case of shock, trauma, nostalgia for what was and uncertainty about what will be.  I feel listless, nothing seems real or makes sense and I dont know where to go or what to do to make it feel real.

"2021-03-20",1616248437,"Between Being Too Careful vs Living Normally: Am I a loser for being serious about COVID safety and missing out on going out and meeting others?","I totally understand that COVID safety is a hot hot hot topic so please refrain from being black and white about it, because Im not attacking anybody nor am I calling anybody wrong. Im just asking for your perspectives, not your end-all answer. 

For months, even before vaccines started to be administered, Ive seen so many friends and people in general meeting up and going out and what not (most of the time Ive seen them masked). All the while I, living with a very stubborn 2 and a half year old and working an involving job that I can work remotely, have been very diligent by staying home and only going outside for walks by ourselves with masks and not even going to playgrounds or meeting other kids outdoors. 

Now that the vaccines are out and things will only get better from here, the activity of others has picked up dramatically and yet Im still wanting to be diligent in staying home and not going to playgrounds or meeting others outdoors. But Im getting extreme FOMO in missing out on taking what Ive sacrificed for the last year, and anxiety that Im depriving my 2 year old on very important social interaction.

On the topic of my 2 year old missing social interaction, I was okay with that for the first year, but now shes pretty much 2 and a half years old, shes getting far more advanced comprehensively and confidently able to run around without tripping too much, so at this point she should get more stimulation than a puzzle or toy. 

As for my FOMO, Ive worked so hard to overcome feeling like a loser for the last 15 years (Im 35) because Im so socially awkward sometimes. Before this pandemic I was pretty good at making small talk and listening to others and so forth because Ive worked on forcing myself to do so, where as my introverted self would just sulk and not talk to anybody. But now, Im afraid Im losing that and Im feeling like because Im being social distant and, thereby, awkward (friends want to hang out but now I gotta say sorry, social distancing, yo), then when Im finally ready to meet friends Ill be the loser that skipped out on the social interactions and inside jokes that my friends will have. 

In other words, if the question asked is hey, hows it going?. Ill say oh, nothing. I stayed home and social distanced. Nothing has happened. My friends will say oh Ive meet up with this, Ive done that, weve done this, weve met up with XYZ and so forth. And then Ill feel horrible knowing that throughout all this time it was perfectly safe to do almost anything as long as you have masks. 

Also, because of my busy job and the very busy task of taking care of a 2 and a half year old, Ive been basically working 60-70 hours a week ever since last march. I dont even have time for a casual Zoom call. So life for me has been work, work, work, work, work, work, work 7am-11pm. Then when I have time to take a breather (which is 1 hour before I pass out asleep), I just spend it watching a few Youtube videos. At first I was very ambitious to work hard and willing to take the impact of working long days because I knew that the fact that I still had a job, and that work has picked up (I work in an infrastructure related job so demand actually increased as most governments increase these activities in order to generate jobs and future demand once the crisis is over), I knew that proving myself and doing well solidifies myself in keeping my job or I get to move up my career faster, but now that the crisis is pretty much ending, I feel there isnt going to be any compensation for the hard work any time soon or at all (companies over the months have basically clenched harder on raises or promotions), so Im feeling less motivated. So now Im feeling that Im working extra hard in every aspect for no reason. And if things are truly safer at this point, am I wasting my time not putting my 2 and a half year old in daycare and at least giving myself relief and doing my job in 40 hours rather than 60-70 hours?

During the peak covid breakout in my state, it seemed bearable. We created measures to not overwhelm the staff and it seemed OK. Now that it's business-as-usual, we are busier than ever but it's so much harder to do my job remotely. We are trying to make up for lost revenue, so it's not unusual for me and everyone in mt dept. to work 10-12 hours a day. But that's just the expectation now because everyone is home and, well, what else do we have to do? Patients still get sick and they still ""need"" us (the usual guilt-trip you get when working in healthcare). Everything feels disjointed and janky. There is no joy in my job now. I used to like my commute into the busy city, my coworkers, the camaraderie. I felt I had more purpose. Now work is just, well, work, and that's it. I've been there for 9 years and I know that my feelings towards my job wouldn't have changed it it weren't for covid.

I never used to have the ""Sunday scaries"" when I commuted, now I do. And all I have to do is open my laptop! I swear if I hear one more ""ping!"" saying I have an email, I might lose it.

I am allowed to go on site once a week, and it's amazing. I get so much done and I feel productive and like a real human with purpose. It's just not enough.

I'm tired...so tired. I miss my old life too! I had a baby at the beginning of the pandemic and you know how many times I've gone anywhere with him (that didn't include doctor's appointments)? Three times. We've done nothing fun as a family. Those three times were once to a store, when his dad had to work late and I needed to things for dinner. The other time to my daughter's school to pick up her supplies for remote learning (again my husband was at work because we had to go early in the day). And the last time to the hardware store because I needed to get a drain snake because the drain to our washer clogged and it was about to leak everywhere...we haven't been anywhere!

Plus my family (that lives in a different state) have only seen him twice. Once when he was three months old, and the other because they were evacuating from Laura (which of they didn't they *would* have gotten hurt because a tree landed on their roof and my brother's house was destroyed). My mother in law hasn't met him. She might not ever be able to! I just lost my great aunt to cancer this Saturday! She wanted to meet him so badly!! She didn't get to! My brother in law was going to fly here for my husband's birthday last year, and meet his nephew, he wasn't able to! 

I'm tired. I'm stuck in my house 24/7 now. I'm disappointed in how my country is handling this situation. I'm upset that my community it's so clueless about the risks. I'm so done.

In November of 2019, I left my severely abusive partner (who I lived with in another country) and moved 5,000 miles back home to my parents. A few months later... covid happened. 

I ended up with debilitating PTSD from the abuse (which I've been working on in therapy and making progress!) but I think that might have affected how I reacted to the pandemic. 

I locked down *hard*. Granted I was also living with my nearly 70 year old parents and wanted to protect them as well. But before vaccines, we didn't grocery shop or go anywhere. Literally didn't leave the house. Worked remotely. 

Post-vaccine, I began going to stores, seeing a few select friends in their homes every once in a while, occasionally dining outdoors (like 3 times total lol)... and that's about it. Oh, I also moved out and now I live alone.

I keep waiting for things to get a bit better, start taking a few more risks, and then they just get worse and I isolate again.

I left my partner and moved home when I was 27. I'm 30 now and I feel like literal years of my life are just gone. 

I try to talk about it with my therapist, but I can't really take her advice seriously because she never cared much about covid. Her advice is pretty much just ""oh yeah, it's 100% your anxiety and you need to overcome that and just live normally"" which... yeah, definitely a lot of it is health anxiety, but there still is a pandemic. 


So I just feel so trapped.

Something I REALLY want to do is try dating again. It took so much effort to leave my abusive partner, do the work to recover from that trauma, and feel ready to date again. But how can I? I don't think I feel comfortable dining in restaurants now or going to bars... or should I? Am I being crazy? Am I the only person left in the world taking any precautions?

"2020-09-08",1599533178,"23, living at home, racial anxiety, insecure about not really having ever lived a life","Thought I would share what's going on with me, since I've seen other people do the same and have noticed some helpful comments. Sorry if this comes off as word vomit.

So, about me: I'm 23, black, from a state in the upper South of the US. I attended a pretty competitive private liberal arts college in my state, graduated with honors in May 2019 with two majors, two minors, and a host of extracurriculars.

I had a good time during my undergrad years, for the most part. I got a full scholarship, so thankfully student loans aren't something I have to think about, at all. My school has a huge reputation for being run by preppy white kids in Greek life, and in some ways that's true. But personally, I found a good, solid, diverse friend group and never felt as if I were missing out on much. I was also involved in a lot of goings-on around the school, so I stayed busy.

But, you know, one thing I was never good at was relationships. I don't get them, at all. I've gone on dates, kissed girls, but never had a girlfriend or even really a hook-up. It just boggles my mind that someone seriously could find a person attractive enough to have sex with them \*that very night\*. And that there are guys who do this all the time. I guess I'm just super insecure about myself. I'm not ugly, I thinkI've had several people tell me I'm all right attractive just this weekendbut I just don't get it. I think a few girls were trying to get with me, but I was too dumb to really pick up what they were putting down. I honestly feel like such a beta for having never banged anyone, but consciously I know it's entirely arbitrary and that whole alpha-beta thing is just toxic crock. But the fact that I spent my whole college career and never did it bothers me and I feel like a loser, though I didn't feel so bad about it when I was actually in school. Only in retrospect. Sorry for the tangent, but I guess it's relevant.

I didn't really enjoy my last year of college, on account of I took up way too much on my plate. Spent most of the last couple months of the semester on the verge of collapse, honestly. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do exactly after graduation, so I moved back to my parent's home for a bit. By September I had secured a full-time contract job with a national news organization, which I probably shouldn't name here. It was entirely remote, which meant it would be a good idea for me to stay home and not waste my wages on rent somewhere for no reason. This was very isolating, as I really don't have any friends in my hometown, and I would have preferred to have a reason to move to New York so I could just live somewhere other than my hometown, but it was manageable. It was a pretty good gig. I have my name cited in a few letters from US senators now because of it.

During this time I applied for grad school. Starting tomorrow I am going to start working on a history MA, which is really cool. My new school is in Boston, but I'm doing the first semester remote to save even more money. I also got a full scholarship for this program.

Anyway, that job I had lasted from September to February, which brings us to COVID. Now, back in February, I was what many people would have called a COVID alarmist, by which I mean I would be bugging my family every night about how bad it was going to be and how we should prepare. Part of the reason I felt this way was because I had had to write stories about COVID in China and what a big problem it had been there. I knew it was only a matter of time before it hit us. So when my job ended in mid-February, I didn't bother looking for anything new, since I knew things would all shut down pretty soon. And I was right.

Well, you know how the next few months went. Death, anxiety, isolation, the whole nine yards. As a black person, my anxiety has been compounded by the fact that all the racists seem to have come out of the woodwork lately on Facebook to talk about killing us, plus there's news about us being executed in the streets by agents of the state, plus we are more likely to die from COVID. It's really not something I expect white people to getnot that that's necessarily their faultand I know this sub is bound to be mostly white. But, yeah. The fact that my ethnic group is dying so much lately has really made it more difficult for me to sleep and be calm, and I was already like this the months before George Floyd's murder. So that sucks and I don't know how well I'm dealing with it.

Between February and now, all I had wanted in life was to move to Boston so I could actually get my adult life started. But now I'm stuck at home til AT LEAST January. And I just feel stunted as an adult and as a man. I feel underdeveloped. I know a lot of people my age are in the same boat, but a lot of them at least had the chance to live on their own for a year after college. Not me. Been a loser since last May. 

Only silver lining is that I'm getting this master's degree pretty much free of charge and I will still get to move in January if the creek don't rise. But I've still barely hung out with friends since LAST September, since my job was remote, see? So it really feels as if I've been quasi-quarantining for a year now.

So.. my husband's plant has weaseled their way into getting deemed ""essential"" two days after our state issued a lock down on anyone but essential employees. They are absolutely not essential, but they said they provide resources to ambulances, and therefore are essential, despite the fact that almost everyone in their industry has a surplus they could send to ambulances (which can't be that many ambulances, considering how many plants make the same resource and have surpluses.. it's not a disposable product). The company has such a huge surplus that they were trying to decide what to do with the product prior to all this. Shouldn't an emergency situation for that resource have to be proven before they're allowed to be essential??

My state is currently nearing its peak for the virus, but the company doesn't care. They are open to their employees about the fact that the reason they are calling all employees back is because they just got a large order from a (non-essential) client and it would be too much money to lose out on.

Worst part is, he's in program engineering and could easily do his job from home. Why... WHY do they think it's okay to bring in staff who could do their jobs remotely? This is not the first time his company has made it clear they don't care about employees, but this really takes the cake. They KNOW the virus is active within the company, and yet they're bringing everyone back. At least my husband isn't immuno compromised, but he has a coworker who is going through chemo, and they told him he has to come in as well.

Plants in the U.S. are really fucked up, and capitalism is going to have to change after this (except I know they won't). I'm just so pissed about this, because my husband might get it and bring it home. I work for a non-profit, and they're doing everything to make sure we're safe and quarantined until the state mandate is over. God I hate his company so much and it's a fortune 500 company. He has had people join the team with lots of experience leave because ""get out of here, no other company works this way.""

They have dicked my husband over many times, but the only redeeming factor is it pays really well, and it's hard to find another place that pays as well. Still, at his old team 4 out of 7 people left within a year upon receiving a boss that even HR told the team was ""untrainable,"" and yet they did nothing about it other than sending the boss to a 2 week training, which did nothing, all because his wife is a ""big wig"" in the company. I would love to name the company, but I'm ""not supposed to"" lest I somehow get doxxed and my husband is afraid of that.

Am I in the right to be pissed? Because I'm pretty pissed that the health and well being is being shut down because they got a ""large order"" from a client that is not essential in the least.","COVID19_support",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fyt98s/husband_being_forced_back_to_work_as_an_essential/"

I'm 39 years old, somewhat intelligent, and I've kept up with the news and science as best as I've been able over the last several months. On an intellectual level I can understand every precaution that is being taken by local government and by the people around me. Not only can I understand it, but if I take a step back and really think about things I wouldn't argue with a single one of these precautions. I guess the problem is that I don't live my life day-to-day on an ""intellectual level"".

Work has been remote since March. We *may* open back some of our office space in mid-January (this was recently pushed back from an October date). Even then, we've been informed that nobody will be required to go in and formal surveys indicate that upwards of 85% of our organization is looking forward to a permanent work from home situation. I feel like I should be able to deal with that, but I know I can't. My performance has seriously been in a free fall the past few months and I don't know if I can handle another video conference. 

What's so bad about video conferences? Honestly, I don't know. They were fine at first, but a 30 minute video call these days is requiring an hour or more of ""recovery"" time on my part. I find them increasingly stressful and they actually cause feelings of anger to well up inside of me. When I try and pinpoint what's causing these feelings all I can come up with is ""These are people, not pixels on a screen. Human beings aren't intended to interact this way."" I'm sitting in front of my work computer anywhere between 10-12 hours a day, but lately at least six of those hours are me staring blankly at the wall.

Work isn't my whole life though, I do things outside of work. Each evening I dutifully put on my face mask and walk around the city. I have a six mile loop that I do each night and things are starting to get a bit busier in the city - people are out and about, restaurants are offering sidewalk dining, some stores are open. Surely this would relieve some of my stress, right? Not in the least, we have nearly 100% mask wearing where I am. This should be a good thing, but every single time I pass by someone I just want to scream at them to take it off (even though I'm wearing one myself)...and god forbid I go into a store or a restaurant and actually have to interact and speak with a mask-wearer. It's the same feeling I get with the video calls at work, all I can think of is ""this isn't how human beings are intended to interact with one another"". We have faces and we should see each other's faces, especially when interacting with each other as facial expressions and body language are big component of communication. Every interaction I have with a mask-wearer just adds to my anger.

I know I would benefit from mental health counseling. I actually began seeing someone in January, but when the pandemic really got started he went to telehealth only (and I can't blame him for that) and after one attempt I dropped it - see my comments above about video conferencing at work. I'd gladly seek out the help if it could take place in person and not through a pixellated screen, but that just isn't happening right now.

This is the way life is right now. I get it. Heck, I even agree with it when I think calmly and rationally about it. But if this is the way it is, then I'm just not interested. I'm withdrawn, I'm angry, and I want no part of this life (not a suicidal thought, but just lie me down in bed and wake me when it's over).

Ugh, I'm turned off right now and wish I knew how to find the on switch and I wish I knew how to rid myself of the irrational anger that's simmering inside of me.","COVID19_support",9,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hv6p1d/im_turned_off_im_angry_and_it_doesnt_make_any/"
"2021-05-25",1621912224,"New grad, post-college anxiety","This is an aimless rant, I guess. Covid started at the end of my junior year and the entire senior year has been spent online in a shitty, sad version of the amazing time I had at college. We just got robbed of what should have been a great time with graduation, end-of-year shows, celebrations, etc. I loved being independent and living with friends. Now I've had to move back in with my parents, 300 miles away from anyone I know, and start my job working remotely (working from home is awful, it's not for me).

A lot of friends have moved back home, some to other states. I haven't seen them in over a year and maybe won't see them in person anymore if they decide to stay there. There's a friend Discord and we play games together sometimes, but it's not the same as spontaneous friend trips we had, I log off and I'm alone again. I was looking forward to meeting new co-workers at the office too :/ 

I'm scared in general that offices will never go back to in-person work, or get rid of their physical office spaces, and everything will be stuck in limbo like this. I need to see people and work somewhere that's NOT a house. I should probably move back out and get an apartment, but it seems like a waste of money if work is still remote. Are we really going to be stuck in tiny apartments working from our PCs from now on? 

I'm really grateful for everything I have, like a place to live, completed degree, family, friends online, employment, but it feels like graduation should have been more of a celebration, everything feels very... sad :/ any other college grads feeling this way?","COVID19_support",8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/nkfpq5/new_grad_postcollege_anxiety/"
"2020-03-17",1584474063,"Daily COVID-19 Mental Health Tip: Can you reframe a Coronavirus challenge you're facing, into a personal learning opportunity?","This one aint easy for sure. Actually it's pretty fucking hard..... If you can do it it will give you something positive to look at.  
Your toughest times in life will give you some of the biggest learning opportunities. Every disappointment and difficulty gives you a chance to learn and grow in some way.  
If you can shift your perspective to look at just one difficult thing youre facing right now as an opportunity to learn and grow, it can give you a positive silver lining to focus on.

What am I personally grateful for in terms of a learning opportunity? A few things:

* Learning how to stay calm in difficult and uncertain times
* Learning how to work remotely, and away from everyone else (we just got locked down in San Francisco....)
* Learning how to be a better son to my mum and dad, who are half-way across the world in isolation in Australia, by calling them more and not leaving anything unsaid to them

Hope this helps! I encourage y'all to think about what you can reframe as a learning opportunity. Can help you be a tiny bit more positive, which I think we all really need pretty badly atm...

"2021-11-08",1636394835,"COVID rules are straining my marriage/relationship with my mom","I'd like to start with just the facts:

* I live with my mom, her partner, and my wife.
* We live in upstate New York.
* Our house is in a forest, and our closest neighbors live roughly 250 feet from us. Our second closest neighbors are all about 500-750 feet from us.
* We have all been vaccinated with the Moderna two-dose vaccine since March/April 2021, and my mom recently got a third booster shot.
* My mom has a lung condition - I don't know enough to say more than that. I don't think it qualified as a comorbidity to get the vaccine early, back in the winter/spring of 2021 when vaccine supply was limited - we both heard about a last-minute opening at a local vaccination center and got our shots at the same time then, in March 2021. It is possible that this condition may be a cause for a weakened immune response - I also can't state that as a matter of fact.
* I attend university in New York City once a week, doing my MSCS. It had been remote up until Fall 2021.
* My wife will be moving to Europe in early 2022 for work. Once I finish attending university in NYC, I'll also be going to Europe to live with her.
* Our current house rules include the following:
   * Rule 1: I have to return back from ""the outside world"" with a negative Covid test after certain activities. From what records I can find, at a minimum, I have had at least 11 tests done in  the span of 13 months. All of have come back negative.
   * Rule 2: No people allowed in the house without masks, unless they also receive negative Covid test results.
   * Rule 3: We Clorox wipe down all of our groceries.
   * Rule 4: On the rare occasion that we do allow anyone from the outside world to visit without a Covid test, it is to be done outside, fully masked.
* My sister reported that she had tested positive for Covid, even though she was vaccinated. She lives in a different area of NY State from us, and had recently returned from a trip to Florida when she reported this news. Her boyfriend also reported that he had tested positive.
* My cousin also reported that she had tested positive for Covid. She lives in Ohio, not New York.
* My dad is also vaccinated. He lives alone in a different part of NY state.

Here's where I'll start opining:

I'd first like to say that I think that the above measures come from a good place. I am absolutely pro-science, pro-vaccine, and I definitely don't believe in any of the anti-vax craziness which I won't bore any of you with, because I am sure you've heard all that already.

That being said - because of the nature of my academic program in NYC, I have to go in and out of the city, and I have definitely noticed a change in peoples' behavior since the height of the pandemic in 2020, which, I think that the rest of the ladies I live with have been unable to see due to their secluded living situation. If we were living in Manhattan, or Brooklyn, it might have been easier for them to see a gradual change in the way people have been doing things. What I have noticed, and started to partake in, is that NYC has found a way to come alive again. The major universities, like NYU, Columbia, CUNY, in addition to NY public schools, and others have all resumed in-person classes. New York has imposed vaccine mandates for public workers. Companies have allowed their workers back into the office. People are going out to restaurants, bars, and even nightclubs (and yes, the workers there will prompt you for either your vaccination card or your NY Excelsior Pass, which is an electronic/scannable version of your vaccination card with a QR code on it - I partake in the Excelsior Pass program and have found it to be very handy). The decision to allow these activities spoke to me; it said that there was a meeting of the minds amongst many of these institutions, including scientists, lawyers, businesspeople, and others, and they determined the level of risk to be acceptable. We wear masks to school/on public transportation, and to get into school, we have to show an application that we're vaccinated and haven't been suffering from Covid symptoms. The situation here seems to be under control.

Additionally, because we have all had each other to keep each other company during the pandemic, I don't think that any of us have felt the crushing loneliness that a lot of people have felt during lockdown. Another friend of mine who lives alone, and is just about as cautious as my family has been, decided that being locked down was doing certain damage to his mental health, and decided that the risk was worth taking to go outside again. That hasn't happened to my mom, my mom's partner, and my wife.

The isolation from society, and the companionship, was also bundled with an abundance of caution for my mom's lung condition. All of this is to say that I think it became the perfect recipe for an indefinite lockdown.

Since I got vaccinated, I've been going out again. I've gone to a friend's wedding. I've been going out to restaurants/bars with friends. Sometimes I'll go out to eat/drink with classmates from school (of course, all vaccinated - they wouldn't be able to attend class if not. In fact, all of my friends are vaccinated - even my Republican friends! even my conservative dad is vaccinated.). During the summer, I went out on camping/fishing trips with friends (again, all vaccinated), sometimes we eat something while out on the boat, we don't necessarily always wear masks, maybe sometimes not at all. It's an outdoor activity anyway, so the risk is low. Whatever. I've been out, living life again. I cannot convince my wife or my mom to come outside, and so I've sort of just made peace with that. They're uncomfortable leaving the house because of the possible risk of exposure, and I'm okay with that. I would *like* to start doing things outside again with them, but I'll take video games and a night in with my wife, or watching an episode of our favorite show together as a family with my mom, if that's the best I can get. That's not the bigger issue.

The bigger issue is the general freaking out that my mom and my wife have been doing. This issue really came to a head this Saturday. I was just passing through to pick some things up, since the following day I was going to watch my favorite NFL team, the Raiders, lose to the NY Giants 16-23 lol. That night, I had planned to sleep elsewhere - I just wanted to grab my cooler for some drinks, and a few other things, that's it. When I walked in the door, my wife cowered in the corner as though I were the living incarnation of the Coronavirus. What kind of a life is it to live when you are trying to walk into your own sanctuary, and your family scurries away from you like you're a leper? Anyway, that's nothing new. I've been used to that since my post-vaccination fishing trips during the summer. They would literally feed me dinner through the front porch, and I'd have to sneak into bed to get some sleep, or else pitch a tent outside or something. It was hurtful then, just as it's hurtful now, to be fully vaccinated and yet treated as though you're a pariah. But this week was particularly stressful with school, compounded with that hurtful response upon walking in the door - it was just something I was emotionally unprepared for. She said it was good to see me, and even if that was the case, I just couldn't really believe that to be true, considering that response. She asked if I could put on a mask, and I hadn't done anything that week to merit needing to wear a mask at home, even by their own rules! She asked if I had been out carousing with friends. She asked if I had taken public transit to get to and from NYC. None of these things felt like cardinal sins to me, whether or not I did do those things. I felt like I had been more than accommodating of the system they had created, and it was enough to just make me snap. I felt like being punished for something I hadn't done. It was just all so overwhelming. Then my wife went up and talked with my mom/her partner upstairs about it. I could hear everything they were saying, like ""I asked him to wear a mask in the house and he wouldn't"". By the way - to her credit, up until recently, my wife had been asking me about where I've been, what I've been doing, and asking about my future plans, too - for Covid reasons. I was always reluctant to answer because I was afraid my plans would be torpedoed - sometimes I had already paid for tickets to a game, or reserved a boat charter for fishing, or whatever the case might be. She recently finally dropped that policy and said that I can do whatever I want, as long as I come home with a negative Covid test (thank goodness).

Anyway, I finished packing, and I was ready to leave, without saying hello or goodbye to my mom and her partner, I was honestly ready to just pack it up and head out. Felt like the easiest thing to do. But I went up the stairs, just because I didn't want to leave them hanging. I said that I was tired of all the restrictions, and idk what it is gonna take, but something's gotta give. They wanted specifics. Would I wear a mask upon returning home? Would I get a Covid test? I couldn't say for sure. I'm just tired.

We were having a decent conversation and then my wife said something, I honestly can't even remember what it was. But it didn't feel good. And so I left.

The contempt and sneering at people (like me!) who are going out and living their lives is off the charts. They asked me to put a mask on in our own house. I say that literally everyone I know is out living their lives, doing things again. It's no use. My wife doesn't care about what my friends say and, in fact, gets offended that I discuss these issues with my friends (that's why I'm posting here. I don't know any of you.) She's not American - she probably just thinks that we're all a bunch of dumb Americans doing dumb American things. I think my friends are all pretty smart/educated people (some who went to really good schools and/or work for FAANG companies, US Congress, field biologists, you name it. I'm a nerd and hang out with lots of nerds lol). All of my friends have resumed life - male/female, black/white/Asian etc., LGBTQ+/gay/straight, cisgender/trans, Republican/Democrat, Catholic/Protestant/Muslim/Jewish, doesn't matter what they are, it seems like everyone is pretty much back to normal life (and, believe it or not, I know people who fall into all of those categories - New York is diverse). I value my friends' opinions. [Relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1170/). My wife is also a PhD though, and one of the smartest people I know, but goddamn if she isn't stubborn. I think the only thing you can really do when you have a bunch of smart people together like that is just stay in your lane. None of us are epidemiologists. However, there are plenty of epidemiologists at the CDC who *are* giving us what I have to assume is good advice, and who have degrees in the field. None of that sticks. Anything from the CDC is seen as politically motivated and not to be trusted (does this sound like right-wing QAnon crazy talk to you? lol the interesting thing is, we're all liberal/Democrats, for what it's worth. Not that it should matter.) My wife throws it in my face that my sister and my cousin report getting Covid despite being vaccinated. I try to say that breakthrough cases are exceedingly rare. I'm at an impasse with her. I'm hoping that during her first year in Europe, she is able to come out of her shell a little bit, and maybe by the time I arrive in Europe things will be better, but I am not sure about that.

My mom is similar. She refuses to let anyone in the house without a negative Covid test. She answers the door through the window with a mask on to anyone who arrives. My mom's partner leans more towards my side of things, thankfully. So if it were a vote, it'd be a 50/50 split of Team Perpetual Lockdown vs. Team Resume Life. I'm less worried about my mom, because I won't be living with my mom forever, and I won't be subject to my mom's house rules forever. If I have to get a Covid test when I visit my mom once a year for the maybe 30 more years that she has left on this planet, then I guess that's fine. But even if I move out and live with my wife, it's still a 50/50 split of Team Perpetual Lockdown vs. Team Resume Life. By the way, that's another interesting point that a friend of mine made. Over dinner at a restaurant, he said that by definition, if there is no victory condition, the game goes on forever. That stuck with me. What is the line in the sand that you draw to say that ""we've won""? I can show charts and graphs of the situation in NY vs. the rest of the US...it just doesn't go anywhere. We're in sandbox mode, friends.

I'm not sure how much of this behavior, if any, is normal. I think that it's extreme. It's on the good side of the spectrum, but it's still extreme, in my opinion. I know these are unprecedented times. But, it is my hope that if anyone knows a thing or two about it, it's you /r/COVID19_support . I've honestly considered hiring an epidemiologist for an hour or so, just to examine our way of life and tell us what we can and can't do again. I'm not even sure that that would help. I'm stuck. I don't know what to do, and I'm hoping you guys can give me some advice.

Tbh not sure whether this belongs here or /r/relationship_advice \- maybe both. It's such a cross between a Covid post and a relationship post. But either way, I knew I had to get this off my chest. Let me know your thoughts. Thanks.

"2020-10-31",1604122348,"New job, but completely dreading it. Hate the way we're all backed into a corner.","I have been unemployed since March when I was laid off. I have applied to SO MANY jobs. I finally was offered a job and to be honest, I am not looking forward to it at all. I don't trust public transit anymore so it's a 30/35 minute walk from me (owning a car would cost me 500-700 a month when all said and done - ridiculous). The work itself is drudgery. The company got terrible reviews on every job search site, saying everyone is made to work overtime and the managers are incompetent and have poor people skills. On the interview, I was informed people tend to work 6 hours on Saturdays. What?? I am thinking I might just ""not to be available"" on Saturdays until they fire me. It doesn't even make sense for my position to have to work overtime because it is so piecemeal. The only positive is that it pays well, but I do not want to sacrifice literally all my time for this ass company. I am studying for a class and a professional school entrance exam (job is not part of my career path) and I don't really have time to work on a Saturday even if I wanted to. They even asked if I could complete one of the trainings before my start date.

I am quite certain there will be no respect for my life outside of work at this point. This sounds whiny but I have never been in a position where I had to take a job with ridiculous work-life balance, but the economy is such shit right now I don't feel I have a choice. The job is at a company and I am used to working in university/non-profit and I hate the whole idea. Capitalism fucking sucks. I am also afraid of catching COVID. This position was advertised as ""work from home"" but when they contact me for the interview, they inform me that is no longer the case. They ""appear"" to be taking it seriously, but then why are unnecessary people in the office? When I went in today for pre-employment stuff, the woman who is the receptionist wasn't wearing her mask until I walked up. Do they think the virus hides until people appear?? Is their ventilation system from a future where ductwork vaporizes the particles?? 

I have a job interview next week that pays barely minimum wage but does not have any of that working weekends nonsense and is more related to my career path and is remote. I have a credit card I would like to pay off though so the cash would be really nice. The job I accepted is only a temp position, for a handful of months, and then maybe they'd hire you if they still need you to do what it is you're doing or maybe a different position becomes available. I asked about the benefits for permanent positions (temps have none) and their health plan is shitty and I kinda need that to be healthy. The amount of days off for permanent employees is laughable too.

I feel a deep sense of dread about this position. It is actually doing nothing but the job function I hated most in my previous position, but over and over again for 40+ hours each week. I was pressured to do unethical things related to this job function in a previous position (which I was able to dodge, thankfully) and I am wary of history repeating itself. In a normal economy, I would have closed the little box on indeed and moved on, but I was in desperation and things were looking bleak.

I was offered a contact tracer position in my city earlier this summer, and assumed it was located at the health dept (location wasn't advertised), but instead it was in no-man's land and hard to get to even on transit. And they were having hundreds of people work in person together. For a job that is done on the phone. And when the health department had a case among one of the employees, they managed it so poorly - didn't even tell employees to quarantine at first, didn't even CONTACT TRACE their own employees. So I wrote that off.

This whole thing just fucking sucks. Like a lot of y'all, COVID took away everything I loved about life - seeing friends, meeting new people, going out to restaurants and museums.

My story - I quit my job in April to care for my precious mother who is extremely high risk. I adore her, we've been through much loss as a family, so it was really great to be with her at first. She is a vibrant woman, despite her frailty. I take care of her house, I was exercising at home, I had a job coach to work towards getting a remote job, everything felt great considering. I stayed in touch with my friends. 

Then, major game changer.  My state, Arizona, started spiking badly. We break records daily.

And now I'm in a spiral. 

Much of my anxiety is centered around her. Her heart and mind are at odds. She see's the horrible reports, yet, still wants to go to the store. I know she just wants her life back, who doesn't. No reasoning, though, will stop her. She may be very frail but she is also set in her ways. She is a survivor of a very tough life and this mindset has got her through. She is a very successful woman who I'm really proud of. But now I'm afraid this mindset and stubbornness will kill her. She will take little trips to the store (not a lot, maybe once a week). All I can do is drive her, buy her masks and just literally pray that she doesn't get it. 

Life now feels like roulette. Living with this constant high anxiety, worrying about her going out, worrying about the future, worrying that this won't end, is doing me in. I've lost all my motivation, I am gaining weight, I can't stop watching the news, I can't sleep. I can't stand do any thing, anymore. 

She may be physically frail but I'm the one mentally deteriorating. Depressed, helpless and agitated, that's me, all the time now. 

I feel like a hostage to both the grim reality of our numbers and my own mind. I can't accept this.

I've never used Reddit before, but I feel like this would be a good place to dump what's going on in my head right now.

I'm currently going through my sophomore year. My school is using a mixture of remote and in-school learning, basically working by having online meetings on Mondays, going to school on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, then remotely doing school on Thursdays and Fridays. It's basically just completing an entire workload your teachers give you. I hate it. I hate it so much. It's not even that much work, but how can I even keep focus when there's no teachers to tell me to stop googling random things on my computer and put away my phone? It's like I'm stuck in a constant cycle. On Wednesdays when I'm walking out of school, I always think to myself ""Alright, I'm going to wake up early tomorrow and finish all the work I have to do in my A day classes. Then, the day after that, I do the work for my B classes."" It never turns out like that. Instead, I end up putting it off again and again. I spend Wednesday looking at my phone, having moments where I put it away in my room and go downstairs to work. I work for about one hour before deciding to take a 10-minute break that evolves to a break that lasts the whole entire day. I put it off that day thinking that I have tons of hours to catch up on what I didn't do the next one. I've tried so many things, I've tried beating myself up and calling myself a moron for not being able to finish writing one paragraph with all the tremendous amounts of time I have. I have tons of pressure right now because I have three Cs, and although three Cs don't seem like absolutely awful grades, the people around me are holding me to a high standard because of how academically successful I was my first year.

But the worst part is that ""missing out"" feeling. I've searched up stuff like ""when is the coronavirus going to end"" and ""will we wear masks and social distance forever"" because I just want it to end. I view high school as an extremely important part of your life and one that you should always make the most of and be able to smile back on. Freshman year seemed like a great start - I got an Academic Letter Award and I decided to join my school's marching band which helped me make new friends and was a massive highlight of that year. I expected to hate it, but it ended up being amazing. This year, though, is completely different. All the activities I did last year are completely watered down and everything that made them fun is now ripped away. All my friends go to school on different days, so I barely socialize with anyone. One of my classes was originally based on learning to kayak in the pool, but they closed it, so now we just run through everything we did last year. I know that this is absolutely nothing compared to the current seniors and especially last year's seniors who are having one of the most important years of their high school experience ripped away from them, and I know this is most likely going to end sometime during my junior year (and obviously this is nothing compared to those losing their loved ones). However, that doesn't matter to me. I just want it to end already and go back to normal so I can go back to actually liking high school again. I took a normal life for granted so much. Current life feels so empty and without meaning compared to last year.

I even heard that our school has the chance of going completely online. I want anything but that. I don't want to stay holed up on a computer screen. I try to stay hopeful, but as I see the numbers go up, I keep wondering just how long this will last.

"2020-11-25",1606274330,"Family pressure to visit for Thanksgiving","I'm a graduate student living about 2 hours away from my parents.  I've had high anxiety about the pandemic pretty steadily since early March.  Luckily, I've been able to work almost completely remotely and only leave home for groceries and necessary errands.  I haven't seen my parents since last Christmas, but they are wanting me to visit for Thanksgiving.

My parents have not been taking the pandemic seriously.  They're both very conservative and think that COVID19 isn't nearly as bad as the media makes it out to be.  They both work in the medical field.  My mom administers and analyzes medical tests (including COVID) and my dad is an urgent care physician, but they are both fairly irresponsible about it.  They eat out, go out without masks, visit friends, many trips to the grocery store, etc. 

My sister also lives with them and is in law school.  She's also fairly irresponsible about it.  She regularly congregates with friends, eats out, attends / hosts study sessions with them.  

My dad told me last weekend that he and my mom have both recently been sick with cold-like symptoms.  But they don't want to get tested because ""If we test positive, then there will be a paper trail and we'll have to miss work.  That will cost us at least $xx amount in lost wages.""  I told him that I thought he should get tested, but just left it at that.  I think it's really irresponsible for him to not get tested when he has symptoms and is going to be around patients.  

With all of that and my recent anxiety and depression regarding the virus, I don't really feel like I should visit.  This is partly because of the risk and partly because I think it's a social responsibility to stay home if I can.  

So, I called my mom just now to tell her that I don't think I'm going to visit for Thanksgiving.  I was hoping that she would be reasonable and tell me that she understood.  She said ""Whatever.  I'm going to be really disappointed in you if you don't come.  I've really been hoping to see you.""  That made me feel bad, so I couldn't give her a definite no.  I told her I would let her know tomorrow.  

I'm not sure what I should do now.  How do I respectfully, kindly tell them that I don't feel comfortable visiting?  Or should I just cave and visit them anyways? 

It's not just that I don't want to go (though that is a factor due to depression).  But I also feel that it would be irresponsible.  But I'm not sure if its worth hurting/disappointing my parents or starting an argument with them.  I don't have many people in my life right now and I don't want to alienate the few that I am still close to.  

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.

I feel really afraid of my upcoming 10 day mandatory quarantine in a hotel for my trip. I'm not allowed to leave the room (not even for 30 minutes) due to government regulations and the police are watching, and the thought of staying in a room for 10 days really scares me.

I'm a very outdoor person. Even in winter snowing I still managed to get out of the house to walk around during the previous lockdown in my country. Even during the first lockdown I get out of my apartment everyday just to get a fresh air, even if only for 15 minutes.

I think another cause of my fear is because I'm afraid of giving up on temptation to snack and thus overeat. 

Anyone can give me a perspective on how I can see this quarantine from a more positive light? Or activities that can help me pass the time without thinking about food? I was thinking about working but my employer does not allow remote work from another country ="".

Update: I'm on my last day now and it went great! I think it's because I booked a large room so I can do some workouts, but nonetheless it was fun. I got to (finally) finish my personal projects for my portfolio, learnt new programming skills, had very nice food from the hotel, and read new books, and tried new games. Basically I did things that I would not have time to do had I had not been in quarantine, or things I usually could not focus enough on due to distractions like my friends asking me out, too tired from normal work, etc. I'm kinda sad its my last day though tbh :)","COVID19_support",13,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/rcscwv/afraid_of_hotel_quarantine/"

After over a year of working on a job site with over 500 people face to face managing socially distanced construction with little more than a cut up t-shirt mask provided by the company, I received my first dose of the vaccine today. 

Construction is not typically considered a front line industry, and is on the bottom of most Phase 1 vaccine distribution lists, but we were deemed essential, have had 0 days off, and the weight of the economy on our shoulders. We didnt get to travel, spend time with our families or work remotely - we just lived through the largest undocumented social experiment and were treated as expendable. 

With the help of my team and the cooperation of our trade partners (at times contentious) we have had zero cases of community viral spread since March of 2020 working indoors and in close quarters.

I couldnt have made it through this year with what little sanity I have left without the support of my friends and family (also at times contentious). 

Weve lived through a perverted reality and proved that you can interact and be in close quarters if basic precautions are taken:  our industry could be a case study for opening back up the country and weve been largely ignored and overlooked.

"2020-08-02",1596400513,"feeling like theres no end in sight here","hey guys. I just graduated from university this June and moved to LA county with some dear lgbtq+ friends who are immunocompromised.  It was really rough finishing up my last sem of school-- the finals and assignments were fucking relentless, especially with covid, but I finished and got the degree, without any financial assistance from my family.  This might seem kind of trivial, but I was super excited to celebrate and get a fresh start with a new job, and not have to settle for working for pizza places or do excessive manual labor anymore.

Fast forward to now, and I've sent out dozens of cover letters and resumes, and no jobs are coming.  My small business is just starting, and it doesn't pay a ton.  The rent isn't exorbitant, but the costs of living are cutting into my savings, and if something doesn't come through eventually, it won't be good.  im usually great at getting work quickly, but hiring freezes and no rent freezes are making that difficult.  

We also can't go outside, and when we need to, people don't wear masks, and we've been attacked a few times for ""bringing corona here"" (being visibly asian in the U.S.). The other day a man refused to wear a mask or social distance near us, and yelled at my roommate and I, screaming for us to ""to go back to where we came from"" (ohio). This could have killed either one of us, and we are often not sure if things will escalate from there.

I try to stay inside, but I have ptsd which came from being confined indoors for long periods of time.  It's been really bad lately for obvious reasons.  Our group will writing sessions, and the difficulty of finding remote work arent helping either.

I feel like ive been able to survive up to this point because I know that there is always an end in sight.  I've been homeless, lived in tents and on couches for months at a time, and made it through school on my own because there was always an end to reach.  My most recent job had me facing off against bears every other week, with only an air horn for defense.  I had to make ends meet, and stayed because I knew a day would come where I would not have to wake up to bears raiding the kitchen every other day.  Somehow, this is worse =©

I've been thinking about this whole situation, and living in the U.S.,  am genuinely worried that there is no end in sight.  I can't keep living at this speed for a few more weeks, months, years because Karens everywhere have decided that not being able to get haircuts impinges on their rights as American citizens, and wearing a mask/being a decent person takes away from their Personal Freedoms"".  The PTSD has been wrecking me and my ability to complete basic functions.  I don't fucking know what to do at this point.  Does anyone have wisdom or advice here?  Because I feel fucking useless and like I'm going to accidentally kill all of my friends every time someone across the street breathes in my direction.","COVID19_support",4,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/i2j7oy/feeling_like_theres_no_end_in_sight_here/"

My husband and I have only gone out for necessities and have also been able to work remotely.  Our plan was to travel back to the East Coast to visit family some time in summer 2021 by doing the cross country road trip once the majority of the general population has received Covid19 vaccines.  It will be a year in January since I've seen my family. 

Unfortunately, my mother (66f) has been diagnosed with breast cancer a few weeks ago.  Stage one until she goes in for surgery on January 18th and they can check if it has spread anywhere else.  She'll have 4 weeks of radiation treatment following the surgery.  My father (71m) has also recently been diagnosed with early dementia. 

I want to go home and help with my parents during my mother's surgery and first week of radiation.  The plan would be to quarantine for a few days after my arrival at my family's summer home alone until I can get a Covid19 test.  I would take a flight back, ideally I wanted to drive but my husband is going to stay in CA so the cross country road trip would be too long to do solo. 

Is this safe?  Should I wait?  My mom has told me to stay put incase her surgery gets pushed back or incase her diagnosis is actually worse than what it is.  I do have siblings and family that live near my parents that can provide help, but I don't want a lot of people in an out of my parent's house when my mom is immune compromised and trying to recover post surgery.

"2021-09-23",1632364825,"Need help framing discussion w/parents to try and convince them to vaccinate. Details below.","Ive seen a lot of great resources in this community, so I thought I would ask for some support. In a final effort to convince my family to get vaccinated before we travel across the US to a hard-hit southern state for my cousins wedding in November, I am going to write them a letter and mail it to my parents, and then send a copy of the letter plus resources I would like them to check out in an email to parents and my brother.

For some background, my parents (in late 50s) and younger brother (early 20s) are not vaccinated. I and the grandparent I live with, who will also be traveling with us to the wedding, are. I work in a healthcare setting (but am not a medical professional), so I was lucky enough to be vaccinated at the same time my grandparent was at the beginning of this year. My mother and brother are vaccine hesitant; Ive talked with both on multiple occasions about getting vaccinated, discussed facts and statistics with them, to no avail. Brother has brought up specific concerns that I provided data for, mother has just said shes heard stories but hasnt said what or what sources. Ive reminded her how many people she knows who are vaccinated, how the VAERs system isnt exactly the great source she seems to think it is, etc. Whole family are avid fox news watchers and any time I discuss something remotely political with my father, it blows up into an argument and I often feel unsafe in those situations so I have not bothered talking to him about it in depth at all. Im sure father is in the vaccine resistant camp. Whole family has no medical issues that would prevent them from vaccinating. All smoke/use tobacco, one has asthma, two have blood pressure issues. Otherwise healthy. I doubt any will wear masks at any point during this trip.

Im guessing most people at the wedding arent going to be vaccinated; 50 guests, pretty sure itll be indoors. My hesitancy about actually going is due to my own ethics/regarding my views on big events and the pandemic/vaccination& I most likely will push my emotions down and go anyway due to feeling obligated/pressured by family. Im not very worried about getting ill myself, but am worried a little about my grandparent, even though theyre vaccinated. And of course, am very worried about my unvaxxed family.

I plan on keeping the letter more emotional, and dont want to include too many specific statistics because I feel this will turn them off to it. A simple, emotional plea from their concerned child. Thinking about starting off with why Im writing vs talking, then a funny anecdote about how I was afraid of shots when I was little (though I am worried about them thinking Im infantilizing them this way), go into describing why Im concerned, discuss their fears, talk about my vaccination experience and why I was motivated to do so because of my desire to protect them and because of the values they instilled in me, etc. Try to appeal to their patriotism, frame it as a civic duty, etc.

What I really need help with are the resources to send them in the email. I want to send things from conservative sources. Browsing this community Ive already found one daily mail article, and a podcast someone suggested on a different post though I havent listened to it yet (elephant in the zoom). My family doesnt trust me because they think Im a brainwashed lib, so I need to find things that appeal to them and their sensibilities.

"2020-06-16",1592322115,"Job or COVID-19? New Boss Does Not Take Covid Seriously.","Hi all,

I started a new job 3 weeks before the lockdown here in NYC. My new boss only closed our salon because she had to by law in NY State; (I'm sure she still saw clients on the low). Within those 3 weeks, during discussions about the pending situation, talking about such things as taking the subway and how serious this virus is, she made comments such as, ""I don't get sick"" and ""I don't take the subway."" I thought to myself, ""well some of us do and have to!""

Phase 2, which is scheduled to reopen soon, applies to such business as salons. Clients who receive hair and nail services, for example, can wear masks because the area being worked on is not the face. I do facials and makeup, so it is impossible for clients to wear a mask when receiving these services. I will of course wear protective gear, but I am still very worried as my partner is high risk. He has been working from home from the beginning, has a good job at a great company that actually cares about their employees and is not forcing anyone to come in. But, as we know, not all jobs can be done remotely.

I have health issues myself and if I got the virus, I know I would be very sick. I know my boyfriend, and he agrees, would have a very hard time surviving it; he is very high risk with co-morbidities.

I have been in the salon industry for a long time. It is a very unstable sector; the abuse is rife. I am looking to get out anyway, and have been taking online courses to change careers. But, I need income for school. The owner is funny about putting things in writing and we signed a non-compete, but no paperwork concerning my hours, pay, benefits, commission, etc. I got the basics verbally and the manager asked the owner twice to give me the figures for other important aspects regarding my pay.

I haven't heard from the owner until today, she wants to speak at the end of this week. She wanted to rush back right away when there was talk of reopening even before Albany said anyone was allowed to go out. I know for a fact that this position offers no health insurance and it is not like when I go back I will be fully booked to make $ since I make an amount per client and clients are not going to rush in. Millions are still out of work and during a time of crisis, people are worried about groceries and the luxuries go first. I have no access to a car, the subway is the only way to get to work.

Finally, my boyfriend will completely flip if I go back to work and/or take the subway because he is worried for the both of us.

So, what should I do? Should I buy time? What should I do if there is a resurgence in the Fall? Is this job actually worth it?

We do go in house 1-2x a week, but with the building at 25% capacity, I often go into work and don't see anyone else the whole day.

At first the schedule remained mostly the same. Then gradually everyone started working earlier and staying on later, and now it's just custom that everyone, when remote, is working 10-12 hours a day. We still work in healthcare, and my job does deal with patients to an extent, so when it's a question of one of our patients, who are acutely ill, it's not so easy to set up boundaries. So I end up staying late, answering questions and ensuring our patients have everything they need.

My dept. has 5 people in it, and 2 of them quit in Oct. and Nov. So now myself, my boss, and another person (who is in 1st trimester pregnancy and has bad morning sickness) are stuck covering and trying to hire new people. Upper management is zero help and has even become hostile to any complaints. They always side with the clinicians, who really have no concept of what we do. Anyone who's worked with physicians knows that they just want more, more, more and make it as fast and efficient as possible. We're just expected to work at the same capacity and then some, because we need to make up for lost revenue over the year due to covid. We needed more people prior to covid because it was so busy, then that was kyboshed because, of, well, covid.

I've been at my job for 9 years, and I loved my job up until now. I don't see any of my coworkers, and I'm working in isolation day in and day out with little respite. I'm writing this now instead of doing work because all I can do is stare at my computer screen. My brain literally feels like its on fire. It's hard to just take the time I need for myself, because everyone is in the same boat as me, and no one else is taking the time either. So I would feel guilty if I did. So I'm not sure what to do now. I definitely can't just quit the job I've had and say 'fuck you' to my boss I've had for 9 years. She and my other coworkers are the only good things left.

- visiting my fully vaccinated parents (i would fucking die of loneliness + i go to their house to work bc i can't concentrate at my place)

- seeing my fully vaccinated friends at least sometimes (same thing, my mental health would decline rapidly and i already have depression)

- having some outdoor time alone or with friends (i would feel like crap without some fresh air and physical activity), the area where i live has enough space and not too many people, which means no crowds

- in-person grocery shopping (no one delivers cigarettes lol + more control over expiration dates and stuff + my area is pretty remote)

what i technically can avoid:

- at this school where i learn to dj we have sort of practice parties every week where everyone can play a 20-minute set, the crowd is usually like 20-30 people tops but i don't know about their vaccination status. i can quit them, it's not a mandatory thing but i need those to improve my skill without paying a huge amount of money to rent the room and equipment, and work on my violent stage anxiety.

what else can i do? should i change my lifestyle to make it more covid-proof or my current measures are fine? how long should i avoid public transport? taxis are pretty expensive if you use them on a regular basis (rn i have at least 4 rides per week). i feel like i'm getting more and more anxious about public places, i quit using buses because of severe panic attacks. i don't feel like isolating myself even more would do any good to me but do i have a choice in this situation? hell no.","COVID19_support",14,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/qy3oxa/need_a_lifestyle_advice_for_the_next_month/"

Just this past weekend, I came to visit them and when I walked in I saw my dad and one of the neighbors (whose wife tested positive a while back) chatting and laughing in each other's faces inside the house without masks on. 

I don't know what to do. I should mention I'm an only child and not really close with my extended family so this is the only real family I have. I'm at a loss. I've expressed my concerns about this numerous times and they know it's the reason I'm moving to a new place to live on my own, yet they continue to do things like this that put themselves at risk. I almost lost my father earlier this year from the heart attack and it's extremely frustrating because it feels like he's doing everything he can to finish the job. My parents don't seem to care about the effect it would have on me to lose them and it doesn't feel like they respect or even appreciate how much I'm doing for them.

Any advice on how to ease my anxiety about all of this or practical steps I can take to improve the situation would be helpful.

"2020-12-18",1608263535,"Having a difficult time with exercise","First time poster in this sub. I need some help thinking through something that has been on my mind for the last few months.

I am obese. According to the CDC, I am on the cusp of morbid obesity (BMI &gt;40). I am scared to death of getting Covid right now because where I live in LA County is experiencing a major surge. What scares me the most is that all of the hospitals are out of space, so if I were to get Covid and need hospitalization, it would be harder than in normal times to get good care. My anxiety brain has looked up every study possible on Covid and obesity and seen only bad news.

In 2019, I had started losing weight and was going to the gym regularly. I got down to around 220 lbs, which brought me to a much lower BMI. I got a physical in January and my doctor had told me that my healthy habits were doing wonders for my body. Then... March hit. My job went remote, my gym (rightly) shut down, and suddenly the world outside became a scary place. I had been doing so much better not stress eating, but I suddenly had nothing but time to stress eat.

March-May were ok. I went for runs and generally stayed below 230. It was at this time that I started seeing evidence that obesity caused problems. I brushed it all off. I was staying home and being as healthy as possible. In June, my gym reopened and I cautiously went back for one ""session."" I had a bad panic attack and left almost immediately. It was indoors and few were wearing masks. The gyms closed again in July for a few months. 

Beginning in June, I lost all motivation to do the things I knew were right for my mental health. I started overeating every other day, not exercising, not even showering. I was furloughed from my job in August, which really compounded things. My weight went up to 265. I slipped pretty deep into a depression, and the only thing that got me out of it was being called back to work in late September.

Around the time I got called back to work, my gym reopened fully following [LA County's guidance for gyms](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/docs/protocols/Reopening_FitnessEstablishments.pdf). All people have to wear masks, all activities are outside, and everybody is distanced at least 8 feet apart. I gave it a try again and ended up loving it. I felt so safe. During October and part of November, I felt so good and confident. Two weeks before Thanksgiving, I noticed that LA County was seeing a surge. It has now gotten really bad.

I want to believe that if it wasn't safe for me to go to the gym, then the Public Health people would say so, but I feel like they aren't saying anything anymore because they are tired of the pushback. When I am driving to the gym, my anxiety is high, but whenever I am actually there and exercising, I feel a lot better. I have been eating way better and I have had fewer panic attacks, but I feel like I am being too risky. Yesterday, one of the Public Health people said ""things that were not risky or had little risk a few weeks ago are now extremely risky."" It scared me. I am terrified because I love the motivation I get from going to the gym, but I do not want to get this disease. 

I know if I stopped going, then I would have a difficult time finding any motivation. I have cut as much risk out of my life as possible. I do not go into work, I do not go to the store, and I have no contact with people outside of my apartment (meaning my two roommates). I am a little worried because both of my roommates have partners and while I trust them, it scares me that I could get something from them (that will have to wait for another post). I guess what I am saying is: am I being reckless? Am I not being smart about this? 

I know that it is not cut-and-dry, but it has weighed on my heavily. Please be gentle. Even writing this makes my internal voice scream ""YOU ARE THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW!"" Though it does help to write this.","COVID19_support",5,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/kfdhzh/having_a_difficult_time_with_exercise/"
"2020-03-28",1585354872,"Away from significant other","Dont really know how to start this but I figured I would just put what I am feeling down in words and send it out there.

I am currently in the first week of a stay at home/work from home order which is probably not new to any of us here. My girlfriend and I are apart for the duration of this order and it really saddens me. I have a job that allows me to continue to work remotely and not lose any income which I know is a blessing. My girlfriend works in the healthcare field but is not exposed to COVID-19 directly and is also able to work remotely so we are not strapped financially.

When the work from home/stay at home order was first issued I was initially dismissive as I thought it would not affect us. I figured we would still be able to see each other despite us living in two households. That thought quickly disappeared as she made it clear she intends to stay with a close friend who lives alone. As a medical professional she has advocated for the shutdown from the start so I understand where she is coming from and I also understand the need for social distancing to flatten the curve.  

I experience waves throughout the day. I experience these really low feelings when I think about the open-endedness of this time away from her. Then I start to think about all of the time we were together but not present in the moment and it just reminds me that minutes are precious. We also have complete opposite work schedules where I am a day worker and she works nights. So while I am working she is usually doing her errands and other work stuff and when she is working, she is REALLY working and focused as she needs to be. Occasionally, I will experience a high but really that just means I am focused on a work issue or something else like working out that distracts me from my feelings.

Our communication has dropped and it does worry me a little. I know that we are both trying to adjust to the new normal and it will take some time. As a couple I think we are pretty strong. For my part, I try to make sure she knows how I feel about her so she doesnt have to wonder. I am pretty open about how I feel and I try my best to share that stuff with her, good and not so good. For some reason I am having a hard time connecting with her and I dont really know why. I don't expect her to feel the same as I do and on some level I hope she doesn't because I want her to be happy but it sucks thinking that she might not be feeling the same.  

I feel like a big part of my heart is gone and I am hesitant to tell her that because I dont want her to think I am being dramatic or trying to make her feel a certain way. I needed to be able to tell someone (anyone) that and I am just thankful that this subreddit exists for me to do so.

I know my problems absolutely pale in comparison to thousands of others situations. I also know that some people are in the opposite situation and are stuck with their significant others and are going nuts. I have so much to be thankful for but I just want to be able to hold my girlfriend again.","COVID19_support",5,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fq9fm4/away_from_significant_other/"
"2020-04-22",1587514544,"When will travel be possible again? I miss my husband, we've been apart for three months now","I know that nobody can know the answer to this... but it's hard to find the 'right' kind of speculation on this topic, or any for that matter, anymore as the news has gotten so diluted... if you know what I mean. I used to have a sort of routine and a few go-to sources, even a few that opposed each other in order to get a well-rounded perspective, but things are so all-over-the-place that I can't find that any more.

I know that my problem isn't as big as the ones of those who are critically ill or losing loved ones... but it's really big for me. I'm 24 and my husband is 25. We just got married in the fall. I returned to the US in January to start my visa process while he remained overseas. A month ago the process was suspended for everyone in the system. We had paid for the priority service and I was supposed to be getting my papers back within 30 days of submission. It was day 28 for me when it was all put on pause. I was so close.

Since then we've been trying to figure out what to do. At first, we were really freaking out and looking at all of our possibilities. It is still possible for him to come to the US as he is exempt from the travel ban on the basis of being my spouse, but that would have been really difficult for him because he's still calling into work remotely, which wouldn't necessarily be legal for him to do here and would start at 4am every day. We decided to just wait another month and see what happens. A lot of people at his company are getting furloughed and he may be too. I don't know how that will affect my visa status, our future, anything. I don't know how I can handle that additional level of uncertainty for us on top of all of this while still being apart. 

I've been taking things one day at a time and feeling like maybe bans would start to be lifted by May or June, maybe they'd figure out what to do with those of us who are in visa limbo, maybe there would be strict regulations for travel that would make things moderately safer... I don't know.

But sometimes it looks like it starts to go backward... with Trump banning immigration to the US. My husband should still be allowed in... as he is not immigrating, just coming on a visiting basis... but I don't know how things will snowball from there.

I can handle another month, maybe two. I'll find some way to get through that. But if it starts dragging on past that point I don't know how to cope. 

In terms of the actual logistics of travel, we would do so with as much conceivable caution as possible with self-isolation at the beginning and end of the journey. 

I also don't believe in making exceptions just for us, like I think that we should all be looking at what we can do on an individual basis but in terms of this particular issue, there are a lot of other people hurting and families that are separated... which is especially difficult during this time of extreme uncertainty and unease. I will 100% hunker down and wait for the sake of saving lives, not contributing to the overwhelm of hospitals, etc. But there's only so long that you can prevent families from being together... and not to repeat Trump here by any means... 

I'm wondering what direction to think in here. It's easy to get all doomsday or down about it and think that this lockdown could last for a year or more... but there's the other side of it where they're going to *have* to find a way to get some movement going again before that, even if it's limited.... Or issue travel permits on the basis of application such as *""I need to get back to my husband""*... whereas *""I want to go on a holiday""* wouldn't cut it.

&amp;#x200B;

What direction should I be leaning here? I know that nobody can say with 100% certainty, but I legitimately can't find any useful information to guide me anymore... there's so much confirmation bias in articles to support anything that you're looking for. What do you personally think? Based on what you've been reading? Your education and profession - law, economics, finance, public health, anything that even remotely relates to policy... mental health, etc.","COVID19_support",8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/g5qzmz/when_will_travel_be_possible_again_i_miss_my/"
"2020-04-15",1586993322,"I shouldn't be this panicked","Just need to get this out somewhere. So, thanks in advance for listening/reading. My wife is really my only friend and I cant keep burdening her with my unpredictable anxiety. 

I should also preface this by acknowledging that Ive been pretty lucky so far in the pandemic, and in life in general, I suppose. No one I know directly has even been infected. My job is teaching online for a public university, so I was quite used to the whole concept of quarantine before it started. My wife is a journalist and can largely do her job remotely as well. Even as I write this I feel supremely guilty for struggling with all of this so much, especially when so many people are experiencing something far, far worse. 

I have such a crippling fear of the unknown in everything going on. As Ive seen others mention here, my anxiety will swing wildly from feeling like I have a pretty good handle on things and feeling optimistic about the future to feeling like the walls are caving in and sobbing hysterically in bed. My university was already planning budget cuts (and likely faculty cuts) before the pandemic hit. Supposedly Ill find out on Friday if Ill be renewed for another year (Im not tenure track) when the school budget is released. Pretty sure Im safe on this round of cuts considering that Ive been tasked with some large long term projects very recently, but its basically a given that enrollment will drop next fall. Thatll mean more cuts. My wifes employer was also planning layoffs before the pandemic. Youd expect media outlets to be doing quite well right now given all of the traffic on getting news, but no one is buying ads since pretty much every company is in a financial crunch with the quarantine. We could probably get by with one of us losing a job, but the possibility of us both losing our jobs during the pandemic seems very, very real. 

We just bought our house a few years ago in a great neighborhood and our kid wouldve been finishing his first year of kindergarten in one of the best school districts in the state. Now Im juggling my regular teaching load with teaching him, and hes having some pretty bad behavioral problems adjusting to this insanity. I feel supremely guilty (and worry about the long term effects, like passing on my stupid anxiety to him) for snapping at him and/or having to leave him alone to play by himself for long stretches while my wife and I work, but we have so little time to actually do our jobs from home. So now that theres talk of the fall semester being impacted as well, it seems like theres no end in sight. 

Id feel so much better about things if I had even the slightest bit of faith in the federal governments ability to handle both the pandemic and the economic fallout. At the moment it just seems like theyre as rudderless as everyone else. I know every generation has to deal with some level of fear and uncertainty, but the whole world seems so incredibly more precarious now than it did last year. I should be happy. I have my dream job, I have a wife, I have a kid, I have a house, and Im healthy. Instead, I live in near constant fear that all of that will go away.

Vaccination in my area is nearing 45% and cases are dropping. In the last two weeks, Ive started seeing people around the office who havent been here since the pandemic began. Its awesome to be able to reconnect with people.

For all of you that are worried that well never return to normal, look for the little signs, like a coworker coming back to the office after vaccination, to help you stay motivated and positive.

When its time, mask orders will be lifted, social distancing guidelines will go away and life will go back to normal. Were not quite there yet, but each vaccine brings us a little bit closer.

To those outside the states, Im sorry. It must be really difficult to see other parts of the world getting vaccinated before you. I wish that the vaccine rollout was more equitable. We live in such global society that we cant really end the pandemic until vaccines are available everywhere.

Even though our jobs can be done remotely, we are currently working on a rotating schedule, with at least one empty cubicle between people who are scheduled to work on the same days. I live with someone who is immune-compromised so I am extremely careful: mask on at all times, wash hands/use hand sanitizer every time I leave/reenter my cubicle, disinfect my cubicle first thing every morning. The majority of my coworkers on my floor think the virus is a hoax and sometimes don't wear their masks properly-- if they wear them at all.

A was absent from in person work the week of 1/4-1/8 on scheduled PTO. Then absent again the week of 1/11-1/15, but occasionally A switches work schedules to work on the other days, which is what I had assumed happened, as neither A nor management said anything about it.

The only person A told of the positive test result was our boss -- who likewise did not notify me of exposure. I feel betrayed, endangered, and livid. Despite all the care I take, I could have been infected. I could have given it to my immune-compromised roommate or any of my other corworkers. Either A or our boss should have notified me that I had been exposed so I could immediately quarantine until I could get tested.

Instead, A claims ""I kept it a secret because I didn't want people talking about me"" and our boss claims ""it is a HIPAA violation for me to say anything about it"" and seem to think it's ok for me to have been in the dark until after the fact. Luckily neither me nor my roommate caught it (we got tested on 1/19), but I still feel like I'm right to demand to be made aware of possible exposure. My boss could have just said ""it's possible you were infected, go get tested"" without saying where the infection come from.

I have severe panic disorder and OCD with health phobias (and an eating disorder and chronic depression, yay). One of my biggest fears is a tooth infection (which I've been fighting off and on since November - currently in the middle of a multi-stage root canal to treat it), another is anything that causes fevers, and while I prefer being at home I get MASSIVELY triggered when I'm ""trapped"" in my house because of past abusive experiences. My therapist went on maternity leave at the beginning of March. I don't have a backup one. And honestly, I was doing bad enough with just the tooth infection and some other issues that I very nearly went inpatient for my mental issues back in December. Ugh.

And I feel so terrible for the doctors. I just...I can't.  


And I feel so selfish. Because I also have a massive phobia of being far away from hospitals or even from a good hospital - even though I'm terrified of hospitals and doctors. (I'm tense all the time, if I think about it, because my local hospital isn't great. And I get TERRIFIED camping or vacationing anywhere that's far from a hospital. Like I'm edgy the whole time.) And now, with how overcrowded the hospitals are or may be, I feel like hospitals just like...don't exist. I feel like everywhere is a remote camping site and I'm not safe no matter where I go. So I've been really selfishly scared, on top of everything else, that I'll either catch this during the peak and not get treated, or another emergency will happen and I won't get treated. And then I feel guilty for being afraid of that, because other people are dying and doctors are working so intensely.  


I'd been trying to calm myself by reassuring myself that Long Island isn't as dense as NYC (at least not out east, where I am). But I got terrified tonight and tried to look up how busy our hospitals are, and it looks like they're getting hit hard too (though I have no clue if they are overrun or if it is manageable). But one has like tents outside, but I'm trying to think that's probably a good thing, that maybe they're preparing and they arent' overrun at the moment. Maybe they won't be. Maybe we've slowed it enough. But I just...don't know.  


So now I'm just...petrified. Like it feels like so close to a breaking point. And of course it's making me feel sick. And I'm terrified of eating anything that doesn't seem ""safe"" in case I get food poisoning. I'm terrified of getting sick. I'm terrified of getting hurt. I'm terrified of falling apart and needing to go inpatient and catching it in a hospital, and either catching it here, or not being able to get treated, or like....taking time away from patients that need them more.  


I'm just so, so scared. And I feel so selfish for being scared about this part. I'm not high-risk (knock on wood, though I don't do well with chest stuff as a rule since I had bronchitis, but I think that's okay? Again, massive knock on wood). Me and my closest people get to be home. I'm not home alone. I'm not a doctor. I shouldn't be complaining. I shouldn't be scared. I shouldn't be so self-centered. I KNOW I'm being ridiculous. (I even, knock on wood, think there's a chance I had this in January. But then I still get afraid something ELSE will happen to me. Ugh.)  


I feel like such a bad person for being afraid for myself. I want the numbers to go down for the sake of everyone, for the sake of those suffering or at risk, for the sake of healthcare workers. But I also went them to go down for my own selfish peace of mind and I HATE that.   


I just want to cry. This is so hard. I've been dreading this part. I'm like....I'm just freaking out and I feel so selfish for freaking out. (And I keep being ocd. Like I keep saying ""knock on wood"" cuz I'm SO afraid of jinxing it and getting sick or maybe the epidemic worse or something because i said the ""wrong"" thing. Ugh. UGH.)  


I want a hug and we can't even hug each other right now :( And i want to help and I just....I don't know how to help. I wish I could go suddenly be a doctor but I don't think I could handle it even if I COULD do it.

"2021-08-11",1628693525,"Nervous about sending my daughter to Pre-K","Hey all. Looking for some support or advice/just wanting to vent. My family has faired fairly well throughout this pandemic, navigating it with little difficulty. I'd worked from home since long before the world went remote and my wife has been a stay at home mom for our 4 year old since her birth. We're very much homebodies, so the lockdowns and such weren't a huge departure from the life we'd been leading prior. That's all changed with the school year quickly approaching. We'd initially planned on sending our daughter to Pre-K last year but opted not to because of our concerns about the virus. With an October birthday she's going to be one of the older kids in class this year and she is severely overdue for the type of social interaction that school provides. Anyway, sending unvaccinated kids back to school with the more transmissible Delta Variant being prevalent seems like a recipe for disaster to me. However, I don't think my kid can afford to be isolated another year. We're in a city where Pre-K is provided through the public school system on a first come first serve basis, so, pulling her and reenrolling her later in the semester once vaccinations are available for children under 12 isn't an option. On the plus side, masks are required but its a full-day class, so the kids have to remove those for breakfast and lunch. Anyway, I'm just at a loss for what to do and it disgusts me that we're still in this situation. At this point, my daughter would be absolutely heartbroken if we pulled her out of school but I'd much rather her heartbroken than suffer any longterm effects (or severe effects) of COVID. 

I'm sure there are plenty of parents out here dealing with the same and I'd love to hear your thoughts.","COVID19_support",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/p2em3u/nervous_about_sending_my_daughter_to_prek/"
"2020-09-29",1601422927,"27, going on...35?","Hi everyone, I'm writing here mainly for purposes of venting some frustrations, and maybe getting some new perspectives.

I'm a healthy straight man in my late 20s, just newly certified and working in a health profession that I spent eight years (college + grad school) training for. I went to a single-sex high school and spent my undergrad living on campus at a religious university, where the social dynamic and science course load didn't allow for any serious kind of dating. (I was raised in a very socially conservative, religious community, and I try to live relatively observantly, but inwardly I am quite a bit agnostic.)  This was unfortunate, because as a result of my community, I have an extremely small socially acceptable dating pool.

I then spent my grad school years in-state at my parents' house in a boring suburb good for raising small children, since I didn't feel like spending huge amounts of money to live a few miles from where I lived by default anyway. I don't necessarily regret any of this, but here is the problem.

I was \*really\* planning on moving out of state this year for my new job, and although mercifully I was able to keep the new job during the pandemic, everyone has suddenly gone remote...possibly for years into the future. At this point, I have close to zero rational reasons to leave my parents' house, other than some vague idea of independence, which I'm not even sure is valid at this point in history. I would be moving to an extremely expensive city, which would no doubt burn a huge hole through my barely-extant savings pile. Also, being a scientific person, I tend to take the current precautions seriously, which would probably get in the way of any real attempts to take advantage of a new city this year.

Being in no-man's land for so long is tough. The uncertainty about when I will ever be able to start living the way I want without having to explain myself to my parents, or being able to take a date home (if this is ever going to be applicable these days), or, I hate to say it, even making friends of any kind, is really starting to eat at me. I am generally productive at my home office, and I generally get along with my family, but there are times when.....well, things get a little tense. School was hard, and yours truly needs to catch a break or two.

So, reddit, what would you do if you were me? Do I get on my rickety horse of adult-ness and ride off into the COVID sunset? Or do I keep taking cold showers, saving, and waiting for a better day? I appreciate any and all useful and constructive feedback. Let me know if you need more info, as long as it's relatively untraceable. Many thanks.","COVID19_support",5,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/j2azns/27_going_on35/"

"2020-04-29",1588186151,"Had anyone filed a state complaint about their employer or a business that isn't operating as it should during the pandemic? How did it go?","When this all started, my employer told me I was to work from home. Not doing my specific job, but still doing a job so that I could get paid and keep my insurance. Today, after no changes to our governor's mandates, I was told I have to go back to full time tomorrow. My business is essential, however my department is only supposed to do things remotely as it specifically is not essential unless there's an appointment with a customer. I have been going in by appointment only for a little over a month, and it's worked out fine. But now I have to go back full time and I'm worried. 

A couple coworkers told me I should file a complaint through our states public health website, and it looks like my complaint would be valid. My employer is telling me to report to my worksite when I could be working from home. It's not as if we have customer's in and out all day, we've only had two this week and I went in for those and left when I was done, as I to do my direct supervisor. 

I'm curious if anyone has actually reported businesses,  and if I do, what should I expect. Will the owner find out it was me? Can he fire me for reporting, even if it somehow ends up that I still have to come in full time? This whole thing is very nerve wracking.

Our job is 100% done on the computer, through a virtual network. My boss laughed when my coworker said she was given the message to tell her we want to work from home. Boss said, ""Well good luck with that!""

They sent out an email yesterday saying anyone who had the ""ability"" to work from home would have to do so starting Monday. It was signed with our immediate boss's name, her supervisor, and a few others.

Our immediate boss emailed us, didn't even come out of her office to talk to us about it, saying that this only applied to departments where they already had the ability to work remotely - - not us. She didn't even apologize, just said to wash our hands and wipe down our desks. She said we would be ordering disinfecting wipes as if that would solve all of our problems.

One lady came back from a cruise on Tuesday. She apparently ""didn't know"" she was supposed to self-isolate. Now she's gone for two weeks. Lot of good that does now. Another coworker just got back from Miami today.

I called out today because this whole situation has made me a nervous wreck. I can't sleep, I can't eat, and I've been nauseated. I'm not sure what to do at this point. Is there anything I can do? My boss just got back on Monday from a bike event in a decent-sized city in our state (that was apparently canceled yet these idiots decided to gather anyway) so I'm kind of afraid to even go in her office to tell her how I feel.

I have mild asthma. My mom has high blood pressure, history of stroke, chronic pain, and my dad will be 60 this year. I still live with them. This is a recipe for disaster.

I told them I didn't want to give them the company name unless they could actually do something about it, and that I wanted to remain 100% anonymous.

"2020-12-07",1607304445,"Would enjoy some cold, hard facts about the longevity of the disease","My mind is still haunted by the idea of ""long COVID"". It's pretty much the only thing about the bug I actually fear. I'm quarantining myself quite effectively when compared to most of my peers (because the cases have been so low, everyone else has had mostly a normal autumn, albeit wearing masks and washing hands more). Currently, the cases are on the rise again and more people are joining me in the temporarily solitary lifestyle.

My mum and dad are old enough to be on an elevated risk, with my mum having actual health conditions. Both have been staying at home since March, with visits to them being extremely few. My pa can't work from home but he and his workplace take safety quite seriously. My mum, on the other hand, has been working remotely for a good while. 

I'm not particularly worried about anyone in my family *dying* of the disease. It has such a low mortality rate, plus the cases are still quite low. And both my parents and I do extra work to stay safe, at least when compared to others around here. The chances of someone dying are simply astronomical. I do worry a little, of course, but it never reaches unreasonable amounts.

As I said, what I do worry about is the long-term effects. Some people say that the disease causes brain damage with a few years delay, regardless of the severity of the illness. Heart damage on non-symptomatic people [has already been observed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertglatter/2020/08/17/covid-19-can-cause-heart-damageeven-if-you-are-asymptomatic/?sh=683cfa786cef), so it is hardly a long shot. Since the pandemic was declared, I have had a nagging feeling that the mortality rate will start rising sharply after a couple of years. My worst fear is that the eventual vaccine(s) will not only fail to protect the receiver from these symptoms, but may even cause them in him or her. Bad virus proteins in a rushed vaccine ending up lodged in the brain, preventing proper sleep for the rest of one's life and so on. I heard this hypothesis from a not-particularly-credible source, but my fear is still very real.

It has been of zero comfort that I have experienced what appears to be low blood pressure (ears ringing, vision dimming, dizziness and nausea) from relatively mild exercise. Usually it happens when I'm doing an exercise focused on either few big muscles (riding a bike uphill, running, doing press-ups) or a large group of smaller muscles (scaling a difficult obstacle course that requires both arms and legs without pause). But now I felt like I almost fainted on the floor by simply playing Ring Fit Adventure and doing lots of wide squats and planks in quick succession; something I was previously able to do without issues supposedly relating to blood pressure. Before, I would not want to throw up on the floor: I would simply be tired afterwards. Perhaps I haven't just had enough exercise lately, but the alternative is that I have had the bug without knowing and am now literally heartbroken, with years of my future lost to an eventual, early death.

Sometimes, the dizziness comes from very minor mental stress when I'm playing a game I enjoy. This type of dizziness only lasts a few seconds, and only when I think about losing in the game (it's elimination-based), but it's still odd as it has not occurred before, really. I am familiar with the feeling, but it has normally only occurred when I am about to mess something up very, very badly, like missing the only train to my destination and having zero backup possibilities. I am wondering if this might be my brain getting tired of long-term stress and finally giving in. During my history of heavy periods of anxiety, I have not previously had any physical symptoms. 

TLDR: COVID-19 has been observed to damage one's body even if the patient was not symptomatic. Scared that the damage might be severely life-impairing, or even lethal, after a few years. My own body has expressed things that could potentially suggest me having had the disease asymptomatic and my body now being damaged in this way.

There's no possibility of working remotely for me, so it's N95s and slathering myself in sanitizer all the way. Unfortunately, following every safety recommendation and isolating as much as humanly possible outside work (I even have my groceries delivered) didn't help-- I still tested positive a couple of weeks before Thanksgiving. I quarantined responsibly and was able to return to work last Monday.

Unfortunately, I'm really, really struggling. While I'm not actively sick anymore, my sense of taste is still badly diminished and I occasionally have the odd, brief sense of chest pain but it's bearable. My breathing is okay, no fevers, the headaches have stopped. Hell, even the awful hives that I had all over my body at one point while isolating are gone.

The brain fog, though. I'm constantly feeling exhausted and just completely wrung out. I have caught myself nodding off at my desk at work several times. And yet, when I go home in the evenings, I struggle to fall asleep no matter how tired I am and how desperately I WANT to sleep. I've been averaging about two and a half hours of sleep a night, where before covid I was a 7-8 hour a night sleeper. No matter how early I crawl into bed, I just toss and turn for hours before finally dozing off sometime after the 4 AM mark. Sleep aids haven't helped; they only leave me feeling groggier in the mornings.

Whether it's in addition to, or because of, my reduced sleep, I'm finding it impossible to focus. I struggle to complete any tasks. My memory wasn't great before being sick but now I feel like I'm struggling to hold onto ANYTHING. I can't remember driving to work this morning, though I know I must have.

We just heard yesterday afternoon about the positive test result for one of my husbands coworkers. He was in a smallish room with her for 12 hours on Monday with surgical masks on. She was fairly early in her symptoms (AKA close to maximum infectiousness). So my guess is that there is very approximately a 50% chance that he got infected.

We are incredibly lucky: my parents have a second home around the corner that they arent living in. So I asked him to go live there for X days. Im not sure what X is. We are relatively young (35 and 37) and have two little kids. I guess X should be 14, but that sounds very painful with these kids and the expectation that I continue to work full time from home. (Obviously, if he gets symptoms and/or a positive test result, X will be whatever the mediCal recommendation is. I think its end of symptoms plus 3 days?)

I opened all the windows and turned box and exhaust fans for 2 hours. Then I went around and sanitized handles and stuff.

I gave him a humidifier and will be running our two others 24/7 except for sanitization.

Anything Im missing? Recommendations about the value of X? With the reality of my husbands job and living in the mountain United States where Covid is very common right now, I think its more likely than not that he will be exposed again, potentially multiple times. So, isolating him in this way for 2 weeks at a time regardless of negative test results (he hasnt been tested yet) would be pretty hard on my mental health. And, he works in (remote) patient care at a hospital, so quitting is a moral quandary.

Ive been looking for a new position for the past 7 months, and its been a frustrating job search. Ive had a few offers, all of which would have required me to relocate, but none that were the right fit until now. Last week I accepted an offer for my dream job that would require me to relocate to Pennsylvania (much higher covid rates...), about 30 miles outside of Philadelphia, with a July 1st start date. 

For my current job, I can work entirely remotely and have been quarantined with my family for over two months. Even if my company goes under, my family has enough savings to be fine for well over a year.

Even though this is my dream job, Im terrified of having to go into the office and of catching the virus. We plan to stay home when Im not working and get grocery delivery/curbside pickup, but how much chance is there of catching the virus from work with everyone wearing mask and respecting social distancing? Due to my weight I am at an increased risk of severe disease, but I am unclear how much more of a risk (if I catch the virus is there a 5% or 50% chance I die?).

I havent had a face to face conversation with someone outside of my immediate family in two months. Were planning to hire movers and rent an RV to move so we dont have to get on a plane (also helps with moving a toddler and two dogs), but I wish I had a better understanding of the risk I was  taking to accept my dream job.

Present number of infected persons is 114,952 in 112 countries and is currently trending as increasing with an unknown exponential growth rate. The number of infected persons is widely considered as being under-reported, due to a lack of tests for the virus, poor virus test performance or restrictive testing policies within the regions.

Experts have calculated that approximately 5 % of infected people have required hospital intervention to survive. The likelihood of hospitalization increases with increased age, and when any other health issues are present in the person.

Multiple reports indicate that the virus may be spread without any recognisable symptoms by the carrier. It may be aerosolized which means it is spread into the air by any cough, sneeze or toilet flush containing the virus and air currents within the area may carry the virus to another contamination area but it is unknown exactly how far it may travel. Medical reports indicate a previous COVID-19 infection in China, is believed to have originated from a fellow bus passenger approximately 5 meters away.

Severe Infection by COVID-19 reported to last up to 1 month, some causing death.

Coronaviruses may survive for 4 to 5 days on paper at room temperature, 9 days on other inanimate objects.

Coronaviruses are inactivated within one minute of sodium hypochlorite solution (Commonly sold as commercial bleach, only specific brands use Sodium Hypochlorite within the solution) and hand sanitizer containing 60%- 70% ethanol but the virus remains on the contaminated surface. Common Soap and detergents surround microscopic particles on contact, including coronavirus, so it can be removed from the surface with water and common hygienic cleaning practices.

Voluntary Quarantine of 14 days has been recommended for anyone that has been in contact with an infected person during the window of infection. Reports from China indicate the quarantine period directed by the Chinese government has increased to 28 days, due to numerous accounts of transmission after the 14-day period. Local guidance may increase the recommended quarantine period in the future.

Statistically, everyone should expect to be in quarantine at some point during the course of this virus. There is expected to be at least one other wave of infections, in fall 2020. There is also a very high likelihood of local school, public gathering place, etc. closures in the near future due to containment measures.

Additionally, a UV light sanitizer box can be used to decontaminate cell phones and paperwork if used within the manufacturers instructions. Specifically, commercially available, certified UV sterilizers, or UV lights specifically designed for biological decontamination, installed within the manufacturers directions and operated within a container that is sealed from light seepage while in use, because UV sterilizers destroy any living cells, including human tissue.

**COVID-19 Contingencies and Recommendations**

Virus in area

\-Order office sanitizing supplies

\-Heightened sanitizing and microbe consciousness

\-Monitor known community infections

\-Monitor information of possible client infections

\-Ensure staff knowledge of sanitizing procedures and microbe safety

\-Ensure staff knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms

\-Procure office supplies for contingency planning

\-Sanitize parcels/client paperwork before use and ensure frequent hand washing during work

\-Notify clients of new policies, possible changes to business procedures and what to expect if a client is sick/quarantined or if the staff are sick/quarantined

\-Expect reduced productivity from employees, due to decontamination procedures, a greater frequency of psychological distractions and increased anxiety in the workplace

Area in quarantine

\-No travel in the area

\-Work remotely, use of cloud network and home teleconferencing

\-forward office phone to employee

\-Ensure ability for clients to sign documents remotely, (licence online identification verification)

\-Business operations are halted except for business functions that can work remotely or from a home business

\-Expect employees that can work during the quarantine to have extremely reduced productivity

Office Supply Problems

\- Due to the interruption of regular business operations in China, there is a significant and ongoing disruption in the fabrication and export of goods from that country. Because a large percent of goods worldwide depends on Chinese exports; the cost of office supplies is expected to increase and the availability of many goods is expected to be interrupted during the global course of the virus.

\-Stock office supplies in the event of an extended interruption. (Business has been halted for two months in some large cities in China)

Employer Infected

\-Predetermine if office closed or remain open

\-Establish procedures for work flow if employer is unable to work for extended period

\-Quarantine of staff is likely for a minimum of 14 days

\-Detailed decontamination of home and office is required prior to return to business

Employer household Infected

\-Home quarantine of infected family member is very resource intense and will likely result in household infection to various degrees. Quarantine likely for a minimum of 14 days after the last family member tests negative for the virus.

\-Expect to not work for the duration of the illness course through the household.

\-Expect greatly reduced productivity from employees who are able to work.

\-Detailed decontamination of office is required prior to return of business.

Employee/employee family member sick

\-Global procedure for people in close contact with any person infected with COVID-19, including colleagues, family members and their households, has been to voluntary quarantine for 14 days.

\-Expect employees will not return to work for a minimum of 14 days after a sequence of tests indicating the infected person is no longer infected and no other family members have symptoms of infection.

\-Detailed decontamination of home and office is required prior to return to business.

\-Expect greatly reduced productivity from the employees that are able to work.

**Priority items to consider:**

\-UV light sterilizer

\-Office decontamination supplies

\-Set office infection control policy

\-Is Document Drop Box outside the office practical in order to reduce contact with clients

\-Pre-establish Skype/Facetime accounts for staff and client meetings

\-Obtain video conference equipment for staff and familiarize everyone with the functions. Practice operating remotely during regular business operation

\-Determine if a secure office cloud network is appropriate and functional for remote business operations and verify it is working properly

\-Determine the requirements and employ a secure document transport/transfer system, such as a courier, encryption software, or USB security keys to allow for remote inter-business and client mail. Verify that the documents transfer system is functional during regular business operation.

\-Determine the applicability for remote identification verification, in the event that personal signatures are required for business operations during a quarantine. Employ a remote identification verification system that is appropriate to your business operations and will satisfy any local legal requirements.

\- Send and post a newsletter within the office, updating clients and employees of any changes to your business practices.","COVID19_support",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fgn92e/covid19_small_business_security_assessment/"
"2020-03-03",1583209103,"Family situation has me overdosing on doomerade","A little background: I am in my 20s, living at home with my brother and parents. There are already confirmed cases in my state, including one just \~25 miles away, and it sounds like there is potentially communal transmission involved. Meanwhile, our current living/working arrangements appear to be the perfect storm for this virus to wreak havoc on us:

* My mother is over 55 with a history of chronic health issues (including diabetes and lupus) plus a recovering alcoholic and former smoker
* My father is over 55, and in addition to being overweight (with a family history of heart disease), works at the local hospital, so his (and therefore our secondhand) exposure risk is very high
* My brother and I must commute 3-5 days weekly via public transportation, often during rush hour, and he travels all the way into the city proper (i.e. lots of crowds)
* My parents do not seem to believe that there is cause for concern, citing the past overblown epidemics (SARS, Swine Flu, etc.), and seem primarily concerned with trying to convince me that everything will simply work out somehow
* Despite my insistence over the course of the last week, we have not prepared at all, not even stocking up on extra insulin or other prescription medications
* My work (small office, lots of close contact) is very strict about allowing remote work, none of management seems particularly concerned, and my co-workers (many of whom exhibit questionable hygiene practices) are relatively flippant in their attitudes that ""its no really a big deal"" because everyone will get it eventually and it has a high survival rate""
* As an added bonus, communally-transmitted cases appear to be popping up on the other side of the country in the very county that my 80+ year old grandparents currently reside in

The only thing keeping me from losing my shit thus far is the fact that this is escalating so quickly and severely it doesnt quite seem truly real to me yet, though I do feel a constant low-level of dread in my gut throughout the day (exacerbated by spending 10 hours surrounded by coughing/sneezing commuters and co-workers). Im really struggling to imagine a situation where we come out of this unscathed, it's like a personal apocalypse.

"2021-08-11",1628721033,"My teenager no longer cares","Background: we remained locked down entirely from March of 2020 until May of 2021, when we were all able to be vaccinated.  Anything remotely social was done outdoors, at more than 6 feet of distance, and we limited those to a very small group of people.  The children remained remote throughout their schooling for that entire period of time, my wife stayed at home, and I work remotely.  We had 90% of everything delivered--to the point where we left the house to go somewhere other than the mailbox no more than once or twice a month.  Like, both of our cars' batteries died at one point, and we're talking dead dead, not jumpable, needed new batteries.  I'm high risk, and had my ass handed to me by a lower respiratory infection January of 2020 that left me coughing up pink shit for a month, with reduced lung capacity ever since that has improved, but never fully come back.

We have two teenagers and one little who cannot be vaccinated.  My wife and I are team Moderna, the teenagers team Pfizer, and the little team I'm praying she doesn't get exposed at school when it starts next week and that masking is at least as effective against Delta as it has been against COVID.  We could not do online again for the sake of anyone's sanity.  Every day was a war.  At any given point in time at least 2 of the children were fighting--with each other or with one of us parentals.  Or all at once.  The little straight up gave up on school halfway through last term, and nothing short of the teacher getting on personal Zoom calls with her would convince her to do her work.

Summertime has been good to us.  We've been able to do some things that in retrospect were probably irresponsible.  My wife and I took a trip (we drove and still masked, and did mostly outdoor activities), we attended a soccer match (outdoor stadium, but no masks), the children got to see their grandparents a lot, went with their grandmother to visit family in another state, and have been able to hang out with their friends.  The oldest got a job because she wants to drive, and we always told her the condition was she would contribute to her insurance and gas.  The job is unfortunately at a restaurant.  As a hostess.  Meaning she interacts face to face with literally every customer who walks in the door.

She got her nails done a few weeks ago and needed them fixed as she knocked a few off or something.  For the first time in a few months, I asked her to please wear a mask in the nail salon.  She LOST IT.  Absolutely went berserk.  Started screaming ""WHY?!  WHY, WE'RE VACCINATED?!""  I tried to keep my calm, responding that our little was not vaccinated, could not be, and data has been showing that Delta is still transmissible by vaccinated individuals.  The rest of it devolved into her screaming at me and my wife, something along the lines of ""I DON'T \*\*\*\*ING CARE, I'M DONE I WON'T DO IT ANYMORE I THOUGHT THIS WAS OVER!""

I've struggled enough as it is with the realization that we're headed back into a lot of practices that we had to adhere to before, and knowing that this time around, we were sending them back into the classrooms that resulted in quarantine after quarantine last year even with masking.  Part of me thinks that it's inevitable that it comes home with one of them and we all get it, because between a defiant high schooler who is refusing to cooperate and at least for now is working an extremely high risk job, a middle schooler who is being forced to share a locker because of school construction, and an elementary schooler who is unvaccinated, I don't see how it takes more than a few weeks for one of them to get it.  To make matters worse, my oldest is dating a boy who comes from a family that hasn't taken this particularly seriously at all (and as a result she was not allowed to see him until all of them were fully vaccinated--her, him and his family), and has transferred to another school.  The town we live in is fairly isolated from the worst of it all, and cases never got really bad here.  But he's going to school in the city, where things got really bad and are again.  And if I had to guess, there won't be mitigation rules at his school.  

I don't know what to do.  I'm at wit's end.  I'm already dreading the inevitable disdain, disrespect, and anger from my in-laws and parents when we start turning down their invitations to go to dinner and the like.  I'm depressed over the fact that I've been at my job for nearly a year, and I've never seen the office (it's in another state), and I likely won't anytime soon.  And I don't know how to handle the teenager.  I can't control what she does outside of this house, and I'm about to send her back to school.  I'm torn in two directions on whether or not to let her stay at her job, where she's only been for a month.  I can tell her to adhere to all of the recommendations, but she probably won't, and certainly the rest of the staff aren't and likely won't--not to mention the dozens of customers that she'll interact with nightly.  But if I make her quit, she'll never forgive me.  It will cause even more disdain from my extended family.

We were going to drive and visit family in the Midwest along the way. Before we left Texas we were planning to quarantine for two weeks and get covid tests. Well, I freaked out because of the rising Covid cases and I think the doom and gloom of the media got to me. Will we have issues going thru certain states and have to quarantine or take tests? Will cases get so bad that borders close? We are not experienced winter drivers and I was scared of driving in winter weather, getting into an accident, and then not be able to go to a hospital because they're full. I think my parents were freaked out we'd get them sick even though we'd take all the precautions. I was also concerned we'd get to Massachusetts, schools would be remote (they're not yet for the town we are moving to, but could be after Xmas) and then we'd have two crazy kids stuck in an apartment in winter. My wife told her boss on MOnday we were still planning on moving and then I freaked out reading the news. She gave me 24 hours to make a decision. I went back and forth and suffer extreme anxiety. I thought it would be irresponsible to take three young kids across the country during winter during the height of a pandemic. My wife said we'd be fine, we'll be in our bubble in the car and what are the odds we'd have an accident. I told her Let's go and then she said are you sure and then I second guessed adn said to stay. As she was about to tell her boss we are staying I yelled out to her that I""m go and she said too late, she just sent an email. Since then I've had multiple panic attacks. I made the wrong decision. Our youngest child is a baby and since my parents won't see him at christmas that means they'll never see him as a baby, which breaks my heart. We were also planning to baptize him at this time in my hometown so that is now delayed. My older kids are very disappointed to not see their grandparents. Plus they thought they were getting two christmases, one in TX before we leave and one at my parents. I feel like I ruined their christmas. My wife is disappointed. My kids are also disappointed as they were looking forward to a Massachusetts winter and snow (and now I'm stuck with two wild kids for two weeks over Christmas break). Plus, it would've been nice to be ringing in the New Year in a new city, new adventure and kiss 2020 goodbye. And we had already said goodbye to some friends and I was mentally ready to leave. I was also reading that it is sometimes better for kids to change schools during the school year socially as everyone wants to meet the new kids, they're a celebrity, etc. I have to tell my work now, too, and they think this thing is all a joke. Some friends think I was overreacting, some think it was the right call. We would've been fine, right? We would've been doing mostly daytime driving and obviously if there was a storm we'd just wait until it passes if we could. And we'd be taking precautions regarding covid. I feel like I jacked up everyone's plans as I was scared about our drive from point A to point B. My dad is super cautious and watches way too much news and I'm afraid his anxiety about all of this may have influenced me, too. I could kick myself. I so so so regret my decision.

Tips, experiences and any feedback is appreciated. Context and questions below...   


My  family (me 40, wife 43, and three kids 8/5/2)  has been really isolated  since COVID became an issue. We are lucky to both be able to work  remotely and only leave the house for groceries or taking walks.   


I  am at moderate risk due to being an ex-smoker (3years).  Wife is  healthy and low risk. Our eight year old and two year old's only risk  factors are age BUT, the five year old has had three ER visits and one  emergency family doctor visit in the past two to three years. Symptoms  are always the same, shortness of breathe causing a low O2 level.  He  cannot catch his breathe until he has several breathing treatments and a  steroid shot. He has NOT been diagnosed with anything and the doctors  just say we need to keep an eye on it.   


Both my mother and my  wife's mother help with child care. My mother has COPD and is at a high  risk level. Wife's mother is generically healthy with a moderate risk  due to age.   


We live in Texas - Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex and  have a TON of family living  locally.  We have not been hanging out with  many people but do porch visits with more than ample social distancing  (10' to 20').   


My BIL and SIL did not wear masks in public until  the recent mandate.and currently have their kids (11/9/5) in baseball.  They have people over (baseball team) and seem not to be overly  concerned about the risk to them or their kids.   


We live a couple  of miles apart and used to get together every Sunday to have dinner as a  family before COVID. They have a pool and we would grill up some meat,  drink some beer and swim - 'merica.   


Post COVID we haven't.  Both  my BIL and SIL work outside of home but are in generically low risk  professions. I disagree with their kids playing baseball but if they  adequately distance and properly clean it may be a low to moderate risk  worth taking for the kiddos sanity. However, I have a BIG issue with  them inviting people over to hang out (baseball team) but it ain't my  home.   


We have talked a few times about trying to get together  more but I want/need an open chain of communication to feel comfortable  adding them to our ""bubble"".  I am requesting we discuss and share info  about when one of our families has a visitor or takes an on an added risk  activity. Per example, my kids went to the dentist this week - that  would be an added risk factor. An activity beyond daily choirs, work,  life that could expose someone to COVID.   


Currently, they are  unwilling to discuss these things and feel I am being intrusive.  They  just tell me they are responsible for their kids and I should trust them  to keep them safe. These conversations are being had with all the other  people we interact with.   


My wife believes the risk is worth the  reward and I don't disagree but want to limit that risk as much as  possible. If they had people over I would prefer to not hang out for a  week. If someone on the baseball team had a fever then I would like to  know before exposing my kids.

I live in an area that has a substantial level of community transmission (on the CDC's scale of ""low, moderate, substantial, high""). Everyone in my household is vaccinated, including myself. The job would be less than 20 hours a week. The employer isn't requiring vaccination for employees, only that non-vaccinated employees wear masks and I'm unsure how well that's enforced. If I do take it, I'll of course wear a mask.

I've been unemployed for a long while now but I'm in the incredibly privileged position where I don't need to work to live. But I'd really like to have a job. I'm not doing anything right now (school, job, stay-at-home parent raising kids) and I wish I could contribute to the household. (For the record, absolutely no one living with me holds the fact that I'm unemployed against me and they know I've been trying really hard.)

I mean EXTREME flatulence and burping. By Thursday, April 8th (2 days later) my wife took me to Urgent Care at 10am. Doc called it Gastroenteritis, suggested Tagamet, and said it could be caused by Covid. My wife and I laughed. They gave me a quick test which came back negative, and the PCR test that would be back in a few days.

The results came back Monday April 12th- I was positive for Covid. They estimated that I was exposed on April 1st or 2nd. So I checked Google Timeline. I confirmed that I hadn't left the house between 3/30 and 4/4 other than a short walk when it was nice out. I wore a mask and kept my distance from the few people I saw.

I was told I would be non-contagious on April 16th. I slept by myself, ate by myself, and lived in my office away from the rest of the family. On April 19th, my wife and kids took PCR tests to determine if they had contracted it or were asymptomatic carriers. All three were negative.

We did everything right. Kids have done virtual learning all year, we used Shipt for grocery deliveries, and only my wife went out when it couldn't be avoided. We have no idea how I got it.

It's been a week since the gas and cramps ended (the Tagamet was magic), but the exhaustion and brainfog stayed. From April 6th until April 17th, I slept 12-18 hours a day. I'm still sleeping 12 hours a day, and can barely stay awake for 4-6 hours at a time during the day without taking a 2+ hour nap. It's worth noting that I'm on Vyvanse (an amphetamine) for ADHD and drink a french press of coffee a day and I'm still exhausted, plus I now have the attention span and focus of a goldfish.

I started a new job in Feb 2020, and began working remote full time one month later. I work in IT and rely on my 20 years of experience and attention to detail to excel at my job. I've always tried hard to do my job well and still keep my work/life balance. I've almost always get positive reviews from my managers (despite my imposter syndrome) and get positive feedback from my colleagues.

While my boss and employer in general have been understanding, I missed a virtual-meeting today (11am) because I laid down (10:30am) and fell asleep until 1pm (when a reminder for another meeting went off on my phone). I had woken up at 7:30am and had over 8 hours of sleep last night. I spoke with my boss who has been super understanding and tells me my health is my #1 priority, but I fear that at some point I'll just become a drag on the team. I can't be effective like this.

To top it off, my team has lost 2 team members in the past month and another two are going to be going on paternity leave this month. That will leave us with 4 people besides me. My team is terribly understaffed now, and they are going to need me to step up as one of the ""Senior"" guys. I don't think I can.

(TL;DR I got covid and am now constantly exhausted w/ brainfog)

**Question**

Given my career (knowledge worker), my exhaustion, and my brain fog, how can continue working like this? If this is my ""long covid,"" how can I do my job in a way that is fair to my team? While I generally don't feel bad for corporations, I do feel that I'm not keeping up my end of the bargain.

If I was to suddenly lose my job, I don't think I'd make it through an interview, which is a problem because I'm the primary breadwinner and my wife has been a stay-at-home mom for the past 14 years. When I eventually have to go back to the office (either this job or the next), should I bring a sleeping bag and pillow? make a pillow fort under my desk? How do I work when I can't stay awake for a work day?

I'm sure I'm not the only one going through something like this. Realistically, what are my options? If this is my new normal, should I be looking into disability? It feels absurd, but it also feels accurate.

"2021-02-10",1612972914,"I dont know what my in-laws are thinking + feeling uncomfortable speaking up","My husband and I moved in with his parents for the winter as were both now working remotely and there was no point in us staying in the city.

Over the past few months there have definitely been a handful of questionable decisions made by them, but Ive also loosed up about how much I actually care or worry too. I was posting a while back about how I was stuck in the US at my parents home while waiting for my visa when this all happened. Everyone where I was was very cautious and safety conscious (unlike other parts of the us) my parents especially both being in risk categories. I went from being uber safe, even feeling guilty seeing my friends outdoors, to moving back to the UK with my husband and being absolutely shocked with how  little people cared or took measures to keep themselves or others safe... now obviously, the tables have turned and the lockdowns here are very strict, especially where I am currently, were on tier 5, not allowed to meet with more than one other person outside, nothing is open except for essential shops, etc.

Since the new regulations my in laws have been taking things a bit more seriously... but there are these random, and kind of crazy slip ups that they keep making.

First let me illustrate one thing, my husbands birthday just happened and we were trying our best to find any way to get our friends together outdoors... we did manage to go on a socially distanced hike, and were really responsible with the precautions that we took. We had initially tried to potentially get a few of them together at his parents house, to maybe sit in the hot tub on opposite ends but not inside - MIL felt like that was really pushing the limits so we decided to take her concern (and the law) into co side ration and not go with that option.

Now the following things

First major slip up was when they had some of FILs employees over for yard work, while one was known to be isolating because a family member had covid. They assured us that nobody would be coming inside and that it was fine... I didnt know what to say. The next day MIL and I were casually chatting in the kitchen and she mentioned that she had asked the workers to come in quickly to help her take out the trash - I was shocked.

Next, post-husbands birthday, MIL sent my youngest SIL off to play outside with a friend. Im in the camp where I think its generally fine to do something outside with a limited number of people. Next thing I know, MIL is saying that SIL and friend are going to be in the hot tub together, kind of trying to gauge how my husband and I felt about that, we didnt want to say no (and I was on the phone so I couldnt really partake in this conversation) so we just let it go.. should be fine. Next thing I know I walk upstairs and SIL and her friend are literally in the kitchen! No masks, nothing.

Again, Ive sort of let my guard down, my husband and I saw friends a few times before the variant starting circulating but now were a lot more cautious. Im also only as concerned as I am because the next door neighbor is currently sick with covid and very likely got it from speaking to someone outdoors as they are known to be very cautious and dont even go to the grocery store.

Im just a bit frustrated because all of these exceptions are being made that are clearly way over the line that weve even mentioned pushing a little.

I also dont feel comfortable speaking up... its a covid thing... Id kind of like to open another discussion about this phenomenon....

I guess I just needed to let off some steam, wondering if anyone can commiserate with this situation, I know the only advice is really to speak up...","COVID19_support",4,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/lgwqyg/i_dont_know_what_my_inlaws_are_thinking_feeling/"
"2020-03-31",1585619468,"My well being","I havent been well ever since I got back home. Even when l'm not thinking about the whole pandemic, I occasionally shiver until I take a shower, which is my only foolproof way to stop the chills. I've been eating less than half the amount I usually eat. 

Now it's to a point where I can only take one small bite without feeling sick (I still try to eat cooked vegetables for nutritional purposes), even if I'm starving. I would have increased heart rate all day too. Im also emetophobic, and I tend to feel even more anxious when random nausea kicks in. 

My daily routine is to work remotely and attend online classes whilel also deal with these symptoms, and it's already driving me crazy everyday. But Im in slight relief knowing that Im not alone.","COVID19_support",4,"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fs42qz/my_well_being/"
