Also wouldn't be crazy to ask the salon about their mask policy before setting the appointment, or trying to get an appointment at a slower time when fewer people are there.

I want to so badly, but I dont have a good feeling about it yet. I want to start taking yoga classes in person again, but the room is small and theres a lot of breathing/no masks or distancing, which still makes me nervous. I decided that maybe I will try going to a gym first, where I can distance still and practice in a larger space. I still feel nervous about entering a gym, but I think trying it here and there for short periods of time (30 min) will help ease me into it. Maybe you could ease into the salon idea by doing something that wont take as long. Something where you wont have to sit around others for more than 30 min. I'm not sure what that would be, maybe getting eyebrows or nails done? Or just a cut? This last time when I got my hair cut, I just did the cut, not the color to spend less time in the salon. After the cut I felt so much better. It was worth it.  And if I want to color it, I will just make a separate appointment. That way I'm not there for too long.","12"

""Dear Auntie, I do also wish to have some form of relationship with Mama, but I've been unable to get her to stop with the painful and embarrassing antiscience torrent.

Why don't we try a few rounds of zoom conversation with all three of us.   But please know, it's a hard line for me that we will not entertain any antiscience conversation.  I won't bring up pro Vax stuff, I do not intend to provoke her. I will be happy to talk about recipes and fiction and gardens and hairstyles and nice family memories.

I appreciate how you care for both of us and that helping us to maintain this relationship is important to you, and also it is to me - this is precisely how you can help it happen.

Not everyone will catch this, so please don't assume you will.  The medical system simply doesn't have the resources to keep people in the hospital who don't need that level of care.  There is a lot of hope that it wouldn't be necessary, 80% of people recover from this at home.  They may be tired and ill and uncomfortable, but they stay in their own beds in their own homes and recover without medical assistance. The cases have gone up in my state as well, but many of them are described as ""isolating at home"" or ""not in the hospital.""

I also want to talk a bit about why people with this virus are sometimes described in impersonal terms like ""receiving care at this time"" or ""not hospitalized.""  It sounds cold when you hear those phrases on the news, but the goal is to protect that person's privacy as much as possible.  Providing too much information to strangers can make it easier for someone watching the news to identify someone, and that's something doctors try to avoid.  They may make general statements so that members of the public who may have been in the same public places can be aware of that, but even in this intense situation people deserve privacy to rest and heal.

Also, someone said that it's impossible to panic while taking deep diaphragmic breaths because it prevents the panic inducing part of the brain from panicking. I think I heard it on JRE. Also, try not to read news about this, and if you do, vet it, and make sure it's not a commentator making stuff up. Try to instead do things that don't have to do with the virusjust learn what precautions you should take from the news/articles, take them, then forget about it. Another thing that can help is exercise, as it lessens anxiety significantly. Arnold shwarzzwnger posted a guide today on indoor exercise.

First thing that springs to mind is stoicism. With anxiety, it can be a fear of the unknown, and a fixation on the future. Constantly looking forward leaves little time in the present moment. I won't get into it all here as there's plenty short video online giving overviews of the philosophy and ways to use it to be more present and focus your awareness more on the things you can control, here and now, which in turn can really allow you to think clearer and more positively. Just an idea, it helped me a lot through grief and now more so. Mindfulness in general is excellent and I'd recommend it.

Your post is very panicked, and I get that, but please realise that your thoughts and feelings Are on over drive and accept that you may have these concerns and runaway trains of thoughts carrying stressful and anxiety feeding what ifs and future scenarios. So perhaps you owe it yourself to allow yourself the opportunity to see the line between facts right now and things in your life that you can focus on for positive reasons, and those worries that don't provide you any benefit and only make you feel like you're spiralling into a darker place.

Otherwise theres plenty of things I could say that are positives but you may be too anxious to receive them well.

The way pandemics work will mean daily rises. Even when measures change they won't be reflected in figures for a few weeks so I'd recommend not tracking figures, it won't help your concern.

If you do get sick, once recovered you'll be able to work, and if the state you're in is struggling you'll be vital, so you won't be on lock down for months. Plenty research being done round the clock to get ahead of this too, good evidence for the likes of vit d to reduce symptoms, some promising drugs, tests, vaccine trials etc. Life may change but it always has, we just never had a heads up on it like this is all.

As for isolation, I'm a pro, I've spent weeks alone in my house. Depression was also a key player in my life, when I lost my mum to cancer (she was 47) I was so destroyed and basically spent the subsequent 2 not doing things due to pure grief and despair alone at home. So I am no stranger to being alone, it isnt to be feared.

Anyway I have to stop lol. Please be kind to yourself, and if you are having genuine suicidal thoughts please speak to someone.","5"

I could never go back. This disease has been, since Wuhan, very stigmatized, with people being put on show like circus freaks. ""Oh, you have COVID? Well, the privacy rights go out the window now!!"" News briefings about you. Faceless numbers about you. Talking about *you*, and theres nothing you can do about it. They dehumanize people with this illness, and if you recover, so what? The stigma is continued. I wouldnt be able to mentally cope with the disease.

My anxiety has been having a lot of fun trying to *utterly destroy me* this whole time. I've talked about it with my counselor, and I'm trying to chill myself out, but I still have so much trouble with grounding and keeping myself rational. It's mostly at work, where my job is usually relaxing and not stressful, but the usually calming repetitive process I go through during work is also a breeding ground for wandering bad thoughts. I'm trying to get a handle on it.

Quitting is catastrophic thinking and an overly extreme reaction to getting sick. That's your anxiety talking. You know this hopefully deep down. It isn't stigmatised at all, this is your perspective which again is totally tainted by your concerns and overactive runaway thinking. Reality is that everyone you know will eventually either have had it, or been. Vaccinated. It is no more of a stigma than having a flu, it's just that right now it's bad because it's so new to us and able to spread easier. In time it will become normal and another thing we deal with, but clearly the science is rocketing forward each day and the treatments will become standard like they are now for the common flu... Which wasn't common at one point remember, and now we're more advanced than ever before.
Regarding being a focus of attention: so if your state is showing single cases atm and highlighting individuals getting sick, that's because it is still novel, this will stop as it goes up. So if you are singled out then it's cause your sick when it's unusual to be, so when you are better you are then immune and at a massive advantage to the rest that are needing to protect. I'd like to get sick now Tbh, get it done with and be productive and useful in this new war effort.

Mentally coping is a skill and can be learned and practiced as im sure u know. Please check stoicism out. It could give you some new weapons in your mental arsenal to utilise and keep calmer and more logical. Which leads to clearer thinking and a better, more productive use of your time than being paralysed by constant daydreaming and panic of an imagined future. You can cope, you will manage, its most probable that when and if you get it, you'll sail through it and realise its like that fear of getting a jab when you're little, the build up and concern is actually scarier than the real event. Please, allow yourself some breathing room and mental peace. You deserve to not feel so lost, and believe me or not, you have the power to get out of that hole.

Regarding your wandering thoughts due to work being non engaging. This could be used to benefit you, mindfulness and meditation are allies to be leaned on and listened to. You can gain so much from learning how to recognise these thoughts and to be able to detach from them emotionally so they drift by gently. It's really incredible once you get into it.

The suicidal thoughts, not a professional here however am really familiar with the feelings of escape and I've been there before where it seems like the easiest and most effective way to escape the anxiety and negative thought patterns and heavy thoughts, but you prob know as I do inside that you don't want to die. You just feel helpless to escape yourself and your own fears. Trust me, I've been in very dark places in my life and I've learned a lot along the way, I can tell you without any doubt that these feelings aren't permanent of fixed, they can change and the first step of that, I feel, is accepting that maybe the anxiety is influencing your rationality and perspective beyond a level you should allow yourself to tolerate, and know you deserve more, then take charge of the now. Do one good thing for yourself to explore ways to help you deal with the anxiety, like absorb some short videos on stoicism: the art of not caring (for example), and mindfulness basics, and Try. That simple act of trying is enough to start a small chain reaction.

Please be kind to yourself.","5_1_1"

Catastrophic thinking is one of my greatest adversaries. I go to counseling weekly, and just about every week I'm called out for that. I've always been an overthinker, and while having an active imagination isnt something to be upset over, it can get really bad, really fast. I'm working on coping skills and there are still, unfortunately, some days where I just totally forget they exist. It's not a great time to be sorting my mental health out, but I guess in the long run, it will be beneficial, since I'll have already lived through one of my greatest fears.

As of right now, I still believe my risk of getting sick is rather low. For a while I took comfort in the fact that I've very likely already been exposed (late last month, my grandparents both came down with something that caused fatigue, fever, cough, shortness of breath (I think)...and I never got sick after them to my knowledge) and I'm okay. The numbers scare me a lot, and I'm very prone to fear when others are fearful.

 The flu itself scares me, as I've never had it, but I've been exposed to it throughout my life and never caught it. And my immune system is crazy efficient, I can drink extra water when I feel something coming on, and it flushes out and never has a chance to set up shop. On top of that, I'm going nuts with the precautions (elderberry tea, kiwis, hand washing/sanitizing, wearing a proper air filtration mask when I need to get out, extra water, etc etc). I would prefer to just not become ill instead of getting it, even though I know, with my immune system and current level of health, I may have something closer to a rough cold than the flu. Or I hope.

Coping skills and keeping myself from wandering thoughts are hard. I've been working on grounding skills, like reciting multiplication tables, stating the facts of the things/people I see around me, and occasionally being a bad child and using my earbuds at work for music, which helps keep my mind occupied. Meditation is something I've been wanting to try for some time now, but I've never had the ability until recently to just chill and zone out. I'll look into mindfulness and stoicism, since anything helps.

Again, thank you so much for trying to calm me down. It can be hard because I'm such a stubborn little shit, and I appreciate the help and encouragement, especially in such rough times. I hope you stay safe and healthy","5_1_1_1"

4. I've felt like it's shameful to get it from the start. Doctors and nurses are sort of actively throwing themselves into the war zone, and they understand the risks. But at the same time, it just feels like a stigma to have this disease. Especially when people who may have been exposed are locked away for 14 days, and the people in the hospital have to deal with constant monitoring. I'd go fucking insane if I had to deal with being ""monitored"" constantly by, frankly, total strangers in masks. I'm not an exhibit. Im a human being.","8_1"

I think re-evaluating yourself during a major, disruptive event is totally normal. My partner and I made the decision to let go of most of our close, very long term, family like friend group. The fault lines were there but their actions during Covid made it apparent that there was no way for us to be truly happy and health while they were in our lives. It hurts but we both feel better about ourselves and our relationship now. I am so much more confident. I hadnt even realized but I had pretty much stopped talking about anything I was interested in to anyone besides my partner and my best friend who was no part of the larger group. I started doing a lot of volunteer work (no contact) and made a lot of connections in my community. I even got a job for the first time since my health went down and although that didnt work out it was a major confidence boost. My partner and I have really taken the time to work on some of our issues and our communication is so much better. 

At the end of the day I dont think any of that would have happened with our friend group and the boxes they had put us in.

Covid sucks. My uncle died and my dad couldnt to say goodbye or attend the funeral. So many people are hurting. But for me there has been a silver lining that I am incredibly greatful for.

Going back to the blue ranger, I heard about the incident that happened that made him quit the series entirely. Gay people really had a hard time back then.

I get it. Present times are tough. But they are also more honest and raw than the 1990s. There is a sense of real ambition again and people are not afraid to work on tackling the tough problems.

When you say people are motivated to fix the structural problems in our country, you're assuming quite a bit. Structural change always happens at a glacial pace, and expecting things to be not just back to some form of normal, but better than normal is wishful thinking. We're in the midst of a crisis of epic proportions, especially economically, and I have no faith that employer-sponsored healthcare or better school systems are an inevitable result of it. If anything, those things will become more embedded and worse for the time being.

You're underestimating just how much people want things to return to life exactly as it was before this crisis, and how hard they'll try to make it happen.

They need cohesive messaging about where this is going and a plan that brings the entire nation on the same page moving forward. And yes a plan to reopen safely the things that we can, to adjust the way we operate our society. It will have to be actual change. Maybe the creation of new jobs that can allow for distancing, etc etc. Don't be angry at the scientists, be angry at the waffling inept Federal Govt response. They could have stamped this out earlier, could have had more supplies squirreled away for a rainy day, could provide more than one stimulus check so far that some will never even receive. Could be fighting less about this and that, and instead be contributing to this kind of conversation in a meaningful way.

There is no right answer or easy answer, but becoming angry with other scientists is letting the real villian off the hook. Scientists are just doing what they can. Infighting among fellow citizens is not good. Divided we fall","1"

But, I have worked with more that are not being reasonable and are not listening to those who want to bring attention to those suffering from the economic downturn that extended lockdowns have caused. If we could come together with a similar message of moving away from lockdowns and moving towards contact tracing and having tests available, that would be a big help. But, instead, scientists are also divided and some are even pushing the idea of keeping up the extreme physical distancing until there is a vaccine, even if that vaccine is years away. Scientists can do so much more than they are when it comes to communicating some of the less doom and gloom findings they are having with this disease. If you look at r/COVID19, you'll see plenty of reasonable discussion that's not making it out to the general public very well for some reason.

Infectious disease specialists see a pandemic and want to take extreme measures to stamp it out, forgetting that there are other implications for these actions because that's not their area of expertise.

It was especially hard on me realizing there may be people who have different motives or intent, and big companies who have power to deny treatments. 

I understand your frustration and had the exact same prediction as you. Since youre a scientist who is interested in mental health, you know just as well the distress humans get when society loses stability and the future is unpredictable and uncertain. For people of science like you and me, when we are distressed ourselves, we intellectualize and rationalize by finding data. The bad part is that our stressed self forgets the first rule of the scientific method and that it so find data that contradicts our theory.

In other words, when stressed, we become unconsciously bias in seek out literature that validates us instead or refuting. 

But I want to say there are public health experts, psychologists, epidemiologist, researchers, physicians, health care delivery researchers, there are a lot of literature being published on what we can do to use this momentum and drive long term positive changes to make health care better. Although youre right that there are scientists who unfortunately may not have good social skills (just like doctors who have bad bedside manners). Remember that that they are still trying to do whats good for society, and also remember there are a lot of people who agrees with you and wants to make positive changes.

In fact I could have wrote this post up myself.  I'm in the exact same boat and I wish I had an answer for you, but I don't.  My housemate (who owns the house and like you, I can't afford to move) has done just about everything she can to expose herself to the virus.  However, back in January before they even knew what the virus was, she was suspiciously ill with all the symptoms (lack of smell/taste, lung issues, coughing, fever, etc) and had to go to the hospital, but recovered on her own.  I took care of her and spent close time with her and either I didn't get any symptoms, or I didn't catch it.  Either way, I have to wonder if she might be immune to it at this point because she continues to do or not do anything to really protect herself unless she is required to.  Course that doesn't include the people she invites over.  I just try to stay in my room, wash my hands, and have as little contact as possible.  The thing is that if she was sick back then, I took no precautions at all and managed to avoid it, I think.

I am so sorry about your grandmother.  We just had to put my 90 year old aunt in a nursing home and it sucks that we may not be able to see her because of the pandemic, even though she does not have it.  Best they said we could do is stand outside a window and peer in.  Big whoop.  I'm afraid that like your grandmother, she'll die alone and no one deserves that.  

So all I can offer is to hang in there.  I wish I had better advice.  Except maybe, and I know it's hard, try not to think about it.  I've had to give up with my living situation and just take it as it is.  It's not pleasant, but otherwise, I would go nuts and all she and I would do is fight and I don't want that.

Yeah. I try not to think about it too much; it just makes me so mad that my housemate is risking people's lives like this. I can probably protect myself--probably--but it means that I can't use the kitchen, can't get rides from him, can't hang out with him. Everything's suddenly gotten more complicated; for example, I have to get a document notarized at the library, and it's three miles away, and I'm trying to decide--do I walk there in the heat, or do I risk COVID by asking for a ride? It pisses me off that he literally doesn't care that he could get someone killed, and that he doesn't care that he's taking away the last little bit of freedom I had and the last social contact I was able to keep.

I've tried to show her studies and such and she listens, but it doesn't sink in.  It is very selfish and she has been quite selfish in that regard even though she is generally very generous in other areas.  I really do wish we were on the same page, but we aren't.  I just have to hope that she already had it and is now immune, or if I get it, I only get the mild version (if I hadn't already).  

As to the rides, would your housemate wear a mask while driving you and you as well?  Between that and open windows would probably be fairly safe.  Even just you wearing a mask would probably cut down the chances by a lot even if he won't.  You can use the kitchen.  Just get some Clorox wipes and wipe down the counters and stuff that gets touched.  They say now that viral spread is not from surfaces as much as they thought.

As for my aunt, thanks for the suggestion.  My sister and I are trying to arrange with the nursing home to do some facetime, so hopefully we can get that worked out.  We have a good friend that works there and he's been great about keeping us informed and getting her a TV.  She also has a roommate, which might help.  But she has been asking about us, and due to her dementia, can't remember that we are not allowed to just visit like you normally would.

I even think its probably safe for you to go back to the library, especially if that would help your sense of isolation. 

First, there are only a few other people in your household, so the exposure risk isn't as high as if you were in a stadium or a music concert with people not exercising precautions. Given that people can safely care for sick members of their household even when they are actively shedding a lot of this virus, you should be able to navigate this completely safely by wearing a face covering when in contact with someone you think may be at high risk of infection and staying 6 feet apart from them. Eat your food in an area away from others. Use a separate personal facility and personal items. Clean the personal areas (e.g., sinks and toilets) before and after you use them if using separate facilities isn't possible.

If there is a shared space in your home that you use with others who are at risk due to their behavior, keep them well-ventilated and clean common surface regularly. I wish you the best in this trying time.","3"

However, you have a misconception about mask usage. There was unfortunate misinformation, at least in the U.S., about whether masks protect the wearer. Masks protect BOTH the wearer and those around them. Ill try to explain why you were misinformed about this by our leaders early in this public health emergency. 

Unfortunately, early in the pandemic public health officials had two hang-ups that prevented them from endorsing facial coverings as protective for the wearer. [1](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134) The first was that the regulatory guidance for certifying masks of any kind for personal protection required very specific uses overseen by trained respiratory and safety personnel. There was never consideration at the regulatory level that the general public might ever have to be counseled to wear respiratory protection and how to use it safely. [2](https://www.businessinsider.com/fauci-doesnt-regret-advising-against-masks-early-in-pandemic-2020-7) The second reason is that leaders, at least in the U.S., felt that it was important that the public not horde masks that are needed for the medical community. Since the mask supply for clinicians is stable now, the messaging has changed. It is truly unfortunate that we were all misinformed about the importance of facial coverings for the safety of the wearer.

The WHO has issued good guidance on how to wear masks in order to best protect yourself and others [link](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks)","3_1_2"

We do not have complete control over infectious disease spread, and infectious disease spread is a part of life that we must accept. It is not your fault that you have tested positive for covid, and it is not your fault if anyone in your circle ends up testing positive either. You already did the right thing by getting vaccinated, and now you're doing the right thing by letting everyone know what's going on and by following whatever quarantine procedure your local health authority has in place.

Anecdotally (and I'm sure there's some studies on this too as people have posted articles about it here) vaccinated people who test positive are much less likely to spread to others. For one if you are asymptomatic, but in my circle I've heard of someone getting mild symptoms the day after going to a crowded bar and not spreading to a single person there. So it's not a given that you're actually contagious and infected anyone in your bubble.","6"

I have thought that myself.  It occurred to me the other day that with so many businesses and individuals being in the same situation, I don't think landlords will be kicking out tenants unless there are other serious issues.  I have to believe that they will work with the ones they have rather than risk having them vacant.   Same with businesses.  I think suppliers will work with their vendors (unless there is high demand for their goods?).  I can also see bartering for goods and services becoming much more common as people are strapped for cash. It's taking a concerted effort to contain this virus, and, once we start rebuilding our economy, we will need to continue working with each other, just like following any other disaster.  We CAN find a way to work this all out in the end!

I'm not worried about the economy and the overall situation is not as dire as initially predicted. But the virus is hitting the poorest neighborhoods in NYC. People who cannot afford to social distance because they need money to make their rent are dying at a much greater rate. It's also disproportionately killed a lot of young doctors, nurses and hospital staff in NYC - this is just not making the news enough because hospitals are putting gag orders on staff and threatening them from speaking up. These are 100% unnecessary, completely avoidable deaths that the US federal government and regulatory bodies should've prevented, but the system was already set up to fail for years and I don't see signs of it changing. The US was already trending downhill towards greater wealth inequality and more dysfunction in the healthcare system and the virus exploited it.

My favourite bit was at the end: 

We love our family members and the last thing we want is for them to be uncomfortable when we are around.

To make someone uncomfortable seems to me to defeat the purpose of everything we have done to this point as a society.

So we compromise, because at the end of the day, for our mental health and the health of the world, surviving everything is the most satisfying together.

Theres no wrong answer for gradually socializing again. Everyone is different and willing to take different levels of risk. I have a few friends who are nurses and doctors and they actually are less nervous I expect because theyve been through the worst of it dealing with sick patients and they are better at evaluating risks. 

Im more cautious because Ive been isolating for a year and a half. But I do want to start socializing again because I miss my friends and my mental health has taken a hit. So Im going to try and expand my social bubble this winter and see how that goes.

Ive read many articles that have said at one point or another we will all come into touch with this virus most likely. The vaccines dont always block out infection and thats okay. They were never going to. But luckily they prevent severe disease very well. I got covid, and it was mild. It was  like any other cold Ive had, except for losing taste and smell. And even that came back more quickly than I thought it would thankfully. Theres a good chance you and most people could get it eventually down the road. If not this year, maybe next. Who knows.

I quarantined and luckily my husband didnt get it. Now that Im over it I feel more immune (I hope I have hybrid immunity? But not sure) and can go about feeling more confident.

Come next Autumn there won't be much reason for them to. Face coverings have greatly reduced the flu season in a lot of places and there will be people who are grateful for that and will continue to choose to wear them in crowded places such as public transport etc. But others won't.

If you find looking people in the eye uncomfortable, you can still look at their mask - what style, colour etc they choose says more about their personality than their mouth alone, or their hands, or earrings or their shirt. Humans are very adaptable, unfortunately that adaptability is something autism disrupts, making familiarity harder to let go of and the process slower but try not to resist it. Changes may seem daunting but mostly they're not. Social distancing won't endure longer than it needs to - humanity is too social - and in the short-term masks may be a compromise to allow sports crowds, theatres, festivals etc back earlier than otherwise but they won't stay for everyone, everywhere, forever.","2"

I'm not autistic so I don't know how helpful this will be but I do have some problems with social anxiety. I definitely agree that wearing a mask is the right thing to do even though it makes even the simplest social interaction really challenging for me. I'm not usually bothered by eye contact but now I am. My workaround is to just look very slightly above the top of people's heads, which still makes me feel uncomfortable and isolated (and is probably pretty weird for them) but at least gets me by when staring at their hands or something would be even weirder. Since I'm not going to pick up on any social cues anyway, I figure it's more important that I choose the option that makes me the least uncomfortable.

Youve given me a lot to think about. I may really get re-tested to confirm my ADHD diagnosis since antidepressants havent worked and EMDR and CBT havent really been helpful.

Pandemic planning is often based around a heavy flu season. No doctor alive has seen anything like this virus but their career has revolved around influenza.

This combines the best of both worlds: both less pollution and less time spent commuting (also on days that you actually go to the office because more WFH will reduce traffic jams) while still retaining enough RL contact with colleagues.","1_2_1_3"

It states:

""If an individual has access to a test and wants to test, the best approach is to use an antigen test towards the end of the 5-day isolation period. Collect the test sample only if you are fever-free for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication and your other symptoms have improved (loss of taste and smell may persist for weeks or months after recovery and need not delay the end of isolation). If your test result is positive, you should continue to isolate until day 10. If your test result is negative, you can end isolation, but continue to wear a well-fitting mask around others at home and in public until day 10. Follow additional recommendations for masking and avoiding travel as described above.""

I was in a similar funk 2 weeks ago when my office was sent to work from home. I wanted to quit after a day and a half. But now that it has been a couple of weeks, and we've all gotten into our groove, it's way better... Just try to keep a similar schedule that you had in the office. Did you take regular breaks? Do that at home. Did you chat with coworkers throughout the day? Find a way to do that, too \[side note: instant messengers are great - we use Slack. If your company doesn't use this sort of thing, you might be a hero for suggesting it\]. Seriously, go take 5 minutes on your porch for some fresh air once an hour if you can.

Remember that it's probably unrealistic for you or your coworkers to grind away for 8 uninterrupted hours a day while WFH (or however many hours are in your shift). Go easy on yourself.","9"

One method I have learned to help me make a  good decision that I can live with is to list the pros and cons of each option I have.  It helps me weigh the benefits and consequences better.  It can also create a little distance to help me see things as they are.

My husband and I both WFH.  He struggles with it more than I do, because he can't physically get away from work or home. I think that some people are just not wired to WFH.  That said, we have to find a way to do what needs to be done.

Now that I am home schooling my kindergartener, I have to switch through things more which is really difficult.

Point is  its so important that you stay rested you are vulnerable and you are a priority . Try not to  go home and look stuff up .

I should have slept . I keep reminding them he isnt some old guy , he is loved and funny and  we need him. 
Also being in icu the sedation really does give much needed rest in order to fight. I am also telling him he is doing great and to keep going and to come back ! I am snuggling now  with being very angry with his girlfriend for taking him to her sisters party . They have history but she seems stupid about it without any regrets .

Although the general situation is not great, I think it's important for everyone to try and recognize irrational thought patterns and cognitive biases in ourselves.   
This can be even worse when we're in a negative state of mind, and it can cause us to spiral downward mentally, even sometimes to a point where we might end up doing things we regret.

I think that through all of the dark and foreboding thoughts, you know that life is full of both good and bad things. There are always things that make life worthwhile, even in the worst times. There are millions of poor, starving people in North Korea who have been struggling to survive under inhuman conditions and brutal dictatorships for decades, and they are still trying to make it.

So there will be transition period over the next year as its in governments best interest to keep this under control while not killing the encomany so more treatments and possibly a modified vax will be devolped over the next year and hopefully omicron will give people anti bodies so even anti vaxxers can get some protection from serious illness yes the virus will always mutate but it might become more mild like it has with omicron.

As well without making them really sick I think alot of us knew deep down this virus would always circulate to some degree but if its well manged then maybe we will treat it like the flu and put in some protections for winter but no far reaching restrictions.

I think the main thing up in the air right now for a while is travel but even the richest countries will miss that tourist money eventually so more borders will open I do worry about certain racist attitudes that some people may have to forginers because of this but we will get to travel again and I think fairly soon.

I definitely feel really bad for poorer counties with less vaccine access and people living in counties that are very restriction heavy I am fairly lucky to live in the UK where we have a really good booster program and we arnt to restriction heavy (though we did have that awful lockdown last year but at least the government used it to get the vaccine out) 

So unfortunately I think how much the pandemic effects you is gonna depend on we're you live some places it will feel pretty much over as restrictions are very light while others may feel different which really sucks. 

It also depends on what restrictions bother you the most masks dont bother me to much (though I will be happy when the arnt mandated anymore) but lockdowns give me the fear so if masks help to prevent that I am okay with them for now.","10"

You've got a legit problem: you need help because you have been having mental-health issues, your mom wants to help, but you're not sure how she can safely switch households. Even though you're 25, you need to be careful because your heart arrhythmia puts you in the moderate-risk category, perhaps high-risk depending on the specifics.

So here's what you do. Have your mom isolate at home for ten days (or however long your doctor says it takes to see if you're going to have symptoms). Then, she gets tested. At the same time, you're doing the same thing--isolation for ten days (or whatever), then test. If her test comes back  negative and so does yours, she moves in with you, and you two become a household. That's the most sure way.

If tests are in short supply in your area or there are logistical problems with getting tested (for example, you'd have to get a ride on public transportation, etc.), you can ask your doctor how long you should isolate, and if you are symptom-free at the end of that, you can assume you are negative and thus cleared to merge households. That might need a longer isolation period, but it has basically the same effect.

In the meantime, make sure you have a plan for if you go into a mental-health crisis--that is, if you become suicidal, if your thinking becomes blurred or scattered, if you're overwhelmed by emotions, etc. Have the plan ready ahead of time, written out, with any phone numbers found and posted, and plans for what you will do if you can't reach somebody. Then if things go badly, you can just carry out that plan that you've already designed, instead of trying to plan while you are in crisis.

The risk from merging households might, in your case, be quite worthwhile. Although mental illness isn't usually thought of as a risk to one's life, the fact is that it's harder to care for oneself; physical health usually suffers during an episode of mental illness, not to mention the possibility that one may engage in self-harm or suicide. Mental health counts as health, and right now you are focusing on your health, both physical AND mental. If having your mom around for help will help you stay healthier, then you take that small risk for the bigger benefit, and count it as a worthwhile trade.","3"

I'd been slowly rebuilding, and was hitting my stride again in 2018-19. Concert and music fest cancelations hit hard in 2020, but I found new, simpler ways to enjoy life (more time outdoors in nature, teaching myself to draw, a few volunteer events at the end of the year, etc). Jan 6th and general extremism &amp; hate brought me back down and took some friends away, so I found a new job, met new people, and became a tourist in my hometown. I was grateful and excited when vaccines were rolled out and mask mandates lifted, went to a music fest, and was really starting to feel like myself again. All of that began to wane when I noticed that no one I encountered shared my sentiments, and for the first time in my life, I now feel awkward and socially anxious. My heart sinks when friends and family members go out of town, to theme parks, concerts, and all the things I've been dying to do with others. I would like to feel apathy, but instead I feel excluded and entirely irrelevant. I do attend concerts and still do my 2021 hometown tourist events alone, meet wonderful people from all over the country that I still text with, and for those few amazing hours I'm alive again. Then I go home, the reality of involuntary social isolation sets back in, and the cycle repeats.

That's interesting, I've had the complete opposite experience. Though I wouldn't say that I've ever been afraid of people I certainly had some apprehension, especially in the first few weeks. When Boston was first ""hit"" the local media fixated on a conference at Biogen that had been pinpointed as a major spreader event...well, when I look at the window from my desk at work I see the Biogen building so for a long time it was ""might I have bumped into one of these people at lunch?"" or ""did I ride the subway in with someone who's infected?""

Not sure where your relationship is at, but you could always consider moving in together.

So for now, he wants to monitor the situation and safety in our city. I asked him what we should do if this situation continues for another 5-6 months or more... he said at that point hell most likely have to move in because that would have been too long by then.

I am supporting any measure to make this happen in my own country. 

I think its important to remember that how our countries and states are responding to this crisis is based on the ideology of the politicians involved in the decision making processes. All this talk of responses based on science might be true, but that science is filtered through an ideological filter. In my country and yours it seems like business first. I mention this because aiming anger at the people reacting to a situation, rather than those causing it leads me down a dangerous mental health hole of thinking that people are bad, rather than right wing politicians are bad...you can't change people, but you can change politicians. 

Some people shouting STAY HOME are in danger because they're more vulnerable. These people are often living in poverty already, and families in poverty are more likely to have a disabled person in them. In both our countries they are woefully badly assisted. 

I'm really sorry that this situation is overwhelming you OP. Would you be able to go to your parents and self isolate within their house? It is possible with some preparation to isolate quite well within a house and you would still be able to talk to your family through a well sealed door. And in a mental health emergency, you're a lot closer to help and love. Might be a bit less lonely than isolating on your own.","1_2"

I made a post a few days ago mentioning that I just don't feel like I'm even alive. I feel like I have died already, and I'm just confined to doing the same repetitive things day in and day out, like a ghost. 

I don't want to die. I want to live. I want to live so desperately, but I cannot. 

I'm a highschool student, and my classes are supposed to go back in September. I've been looking foward to this day for months, but so many of my classmates talk about going back to school as if it were so unimportant. Some say they won't go back simply because they are ""too lazy to wake up earlier and commute"" and prefer to stay at home. None of them seem to feel as isolated and depressed as I do. You basically summarized my biggest fear: that very few people show up and I end up alone in that gigantic school, even more lonely than I already am.

I know it might be childish, but I can't help but feel insulted when my classmates refuse to go to school out of laziness or just ""hating masks"" and are super happy to remain stuck inside. It takes all of my hopes for the school to end my loneliness and shatters it before my eyes.

Sorry, I'm just ranting at this point. But I'm really struggling to find people I can relate to, so I figured that knowing I feel the same as you could help. I won't say anything cheesy or give you cheap advice, because I know too well how it always makes everything worse. But I want you to know that this teen, probably on the other side of the planet, feels as lonely and frustrated as you.

I fortunately live with my husband so I have him to help keep me sane, but we both have underlying conditions, and while odds are in our favor that we wouldn't get a severe case or long covid because we are in our early 30s, we still probably have more anxiety around it than we should.

We both have not gotten covid, or been sick at all last two years which has actually been a silver lining. But before vaccines we were super careful, fully isolating other than groceries. After vaccines this summer we finally saw our friends again and while careful and still masking indoors (and avoiding indoor crowds, opting for outdoor events) it made a huge difference in my mental health. Of course once Delta spun up we went back to isolation and got our booster. We did see folks on Thanksgiving who all tested before coming, but we cancelled our Christmas and new years plans due to omicron.

We are fortunate to work from home, so we can truly isolate. We plan to do so through this omicron peak, but know it's still likely we get this variant eventually this year. I told my mom my philosophy here is that I will isolate as much as my mental health can take, if I am at a breaking point I will look to find the least risky social interactions I can schedule. Its worked for me so far, but as an introvert with a husband living with me I think I am lucky in feeling less need to socialize in person. I do think mental health has to be recognized though, and when I need people I will take the risks to see them to keep my mind healthy.","11"

Ive been mostly staying inside, since Mid-March, because I cant drive yet and my parents dont even want to test the waters with returning to normal socialization yet, since theyre over 60 and in an at-risk group. 

My mom is currently recovering from a knee injury and she has had final doctors appointments coming up this week. If shes cleared to return to work/normal physical activity, Im gonna ask her for driving lessons so I can at least have the freedom to go for a  car ride to relieve the stress. 

Im also looking for work to try to restore some degree of Pre-Covid normality to my life. Doing a job, even with masks and distancing, would make me feel a lot better than just staying in all day with my pessimistic, doomer family for potentially another year, or until  I have the money to move out. 

My advice is that theres ways to restore some degree of normality to your life without putting relatives at risk. Get a job, remote or in-person, go for a jog around town, shoot some hoops, or maybe do a low-contact sport like tennis or golf with a few friends you can trust to not put you in danger. Shopping probably isnt that that high risk at this point as long as you mask and distance.","3"

If it makes any difference, the total loss of taste and smell might be worse than tinnitus. I really mean that. Ive mostly adjusted to the constant irritation-hiss (idk how to describe it because its different depending on how surrounding sounds are that day)

I cant taste or smell anything, its aggravating and driving me totally insane already. Salt/sweet/bitter/sour are there, but I cant taste flavors like chocolate, coffee, or fruit. Orange juice tastes like sour water. Coffee tastes like nothing dirt. Chocolate tastes like wax. Cheese tastes like salt wax. Soup tastes like salt water.

I also get ringing, on and off, especially when I'm dealing with any congestion. 

I'm vaccinated. It's fine. Nothing changed with regard to my hearing/tinnitus, for better or for worse. 

I'm not sure I believe the vaccine actually causes tinnitus even if some people say it does, only because I know the sheer volume of things that definitively do, that many people are exposed to on a daily basis without even thinking about it. The only way we could definitively say that these people got tinnitus from the vaccine would be to make sure none of those other more likely variables are at play.

But let's say for arguments sake that the vaccine, definitively, can cause tinnitus. It's rare, but it happens. And if you already have it, it can make it worse, potentially.

I'm still picking the vaccine over potentially getting COVID. Because aggressive viral infections can rob you of your hearing *entirely,* among the other dozens of horrible things COVID can do to you.","18"

But if anyone comes across this and is concerned. 

I had very faint tinnitus in both ears and got both doses of the vaccine and a booster. None of which affected my tinnitus. 

I caught covid for the first time last week and about half way through my isolation period the volume of my tinnitus shot right up and is now pretty distracting. 

As soon as Im out of isolation Im going to a doctor/ent to see what the hells going on. 

But my point is, regardless of wether you get the vaccine or not, covid can still exacerbate it. So Id recommend just getting the protection from covid by the vaccine and take your chances. As it can sometimes happen either way if its going to. 

Unless you plan on isolating for the rest of your life and never catching covid Id get the vax.","35"

You have no understanding of vaccine science and attitudes such as this are playing into anti-vaccination narratives. You had friends who were fully vaccinated but were bedridden when they caught it? Guess what - if they weren't vaccinated they'd probably be dead. Some of them had mild symptoms? Guess what - without the vaccine they'd be more severe. The vaccines have turned a killer, debilitating disease into something far, far less threatening.

Virtually no vaccine provides 100% sterilising immunity to the entire population. The COVID19 is no different in that regard. It's considerably more efficient than the flu vaccine, the BCG that protects against tuberculosis and many others. It is an amazing feat of scientific achievement.

All of your fears are irrational. They are not your logic talking but your anxiety and the only way you will move past this is to get it diagnosed and treated. See this as a resource:

Maybe its too extreme and impacting daily life too much, but we need to be compassionate with ourselves and our base anxiety level that is natural given that were in a pandemic. Im not the best to answer this because I also dont do much, but I have A number of strategies my therapist and I employ. 

The biggest one is really coming up with thresholds of what is the riskiest activity youll do under x circumstances, and to set these thresholds based on science (and when youre relatively calm) and stick to them. For me, that means I will engage in outdoor activity basically no matter the cases, but I might mask outdoors if its crowded and Im uncomfortable with population positivity level etc (also depends on what quality of data you have available in your area). 

When positivity is at x percent (i wont put actual numbers because its obviously personal), I commit do doing masked indoor activities. For me, a lot of indoor unmasked stuff would need super low community levels of the virus - which I had last summer and I did indoor dine a few times, but honestly since late fall it hasnt been something that has made sense. But if it does again, Ill push myself to do it. 

I also very much employ the mindset of which decision can I live with being the wrong one and that helps me feel solid in my choices.

They were back the next month and I asked them how they were - they said they were fine and that all they both had was a bit of a sore throat. 

As Jennifer says, the type of long Covid that you or I would be worried about is a lot less common than the general long Covid statistics say - some studies may say that a cough for three weeks, random loss of smell for a few weeks, or post viral fatigue for a couple of months is long Covid but most of these arent much different than potential lingering effects from other viruses. The worst cases of people being barely able to think or breathe are a minority within a minority - of course its still many people in absolute terms because of how infectious the virus is, and these potential effects should absolutely be acknowledged, but its not as likely as the media makes you think it is. Anecdotally, most people I know who had significant long Covid were unvaccinated, had autoimmunity issues, or other comorbidities like diabetes. If you dont have these and are vaxxed, this reduces your chances of long Covid. Are there people who were totally healthy, fully vaxxed, and still get long Covid? Probably, but there are also people who suddenly get cancer or get run over by a car. 

In a way, getting Covid can be a relief - it was for me, as the worst has already happened, and the most likely scenario, I.e a full recovery, was the outcome. This is the most likely situation for you too, if you get infected - its important to remember that. And even if you get long Covid, its likely to something that resolves in a few months in most cases. 

The internet as what I like to call a TripAdvisor review effect - most people will more likely feel the need to review a place to express dissatisfaction or a negative experience, with few talking about the positives. Being online and doomscrolling (which Im guilty of) can really make you fall into the trap of believing that the worst will happen. If youre trying to find more information on Covid to reassure you, try not to, as youll inevitably find scaremongering information, which is more common for any topic. Limiting online media can really help.","7"

You're right about those with long haul Covid and/or who are hospitalized are in the minority. My cousin got long haul Covid (his lungs are damaged now) BUT he did not get the vax, he did not treat the Covid when he got infected and continued to work himself to exhaustion until he burned out. Thankfully, he has started an intense recovery treatment now for long haul C and it works.

I still have long term symptoms that have made the past 2 years really hard and I still struggle today with health problems stemming from that.  I am worried that catching it again would make my problems worse or start me back at square one after making some progress from the initial horrible symptoms.  I only really do social things outdoors, don't do anything that will add to my risk, and wear a high quality mask when out and have to be inside.  When cases are down, I relax a little.I do what  I can and what I can control.  I hope that more will be understood about long covid and that studies will find some relief for those that suffer.

Naming it does not mean it's inappropriate or weak.  There's no shame in feeling affected - hurt - anxious - after going through a horrific thing.  We have all gone through a horrible thing, whether that's personal experience,  anguish of watching a loved one, or even just looking at the news.  

This is not about minimizing the pain or fear.  This is about reckoning with it and grappling with it and addressing it by finding structured ways to respond and cope so that the thinking about it (rumination) won't hurt you worse than the actual pandemic.   Because that's a real risk for many people - at what point is my fear about pandemic hurting me more than my actual personal risk of bodily damage from pandemic? 

This is a thing that has happened to us, is happening to us.   Let's all of us work on skills to limit the damage and build resilience to heal.   

As the above poster who was pregaming his risk assessment and consequent behavior, this workbook can help you to unpack and then relate your emotional response to the pandemic and how it can, or should, or will affect your life.   Thereby the goal is to feel more control about things,  which always helps.  Results will ideally be very individualized.","9_1_1"

But we'll go out to eat, to bars, go skiing and hanging out in ski lodges, etc. We are both vaccinated and boosted, and to the best of our knowledge, never had Covid. 


I know there are people who get Covid while vaccinated, but I think there are still way more people don't get it than do get it, especially when vaccinated and boosted.


  My dad also has completely resumed normal life including in person work with no mask on, he's vaccinated and boosted, and never got Covid. My mom, however, got Covid while vaccinated but before the boosters came out, but she's also 72, has an autoimmune disorder, and had a very mild case that she says felt like a cold. Meanwhile, my uncle, who was 74, passed away when he caught Covid back in April 2020, when it had just started and there was no vaccine yet.


So yes, I know it can seem scary to start doing things again, but having the full set of protection that vaccines currently offer is amazing at reducing your odds of catching it, or if you catch it, of having anything worse than a cold. Also, I think if you're vaccinated and wear masks even just some of the time, like grocery shopping, you reduce your risk even more.  That's what I do, I'll wear masks still when it's convenient to do so like going to a store, but will eat indoors again. 

While it seems frustrating that we can still catch it, look at how much progress we have made in just two years at truly dwindling down the expanse and severity of a pandemic. it's pretty amazing actually.","10"

You don't need to feel like you've violated parole by going to the hardware store. These feelings of guilt are caused by inconsistent messaging and vague vocabulary (WTF, ""shelter-in-place."") It's an awfully monumental task to ask of everyday people to abide by an unclear set of rules, which is why ""stay at home"" orders are largely directed at the businesses requiring workers to come in under unsafe conditions. If you're practicing physical distancing, washing hands, or even wearing a mask/gloves, you ARE being safe while visiting what has been deemed an essential business.

Sure, we shouldn't be congregating at the beaches, hosting house parties, or even hugging our friends, but there is room for sanity within your state's guidelines. I shop groceries at Walmart or Target instead of the grocery store these days, because taking a quick detour to the makeup or clothing aisle provides a 15-minute reminder of the way life was (and will be again.) I take time every few days to give the dog a long run/walk with a friend or neighborkeeping more than the recommended physical distance. It's not about bending the rules around my lifestyle choices, it's about getting a little creative while fully complying, and feeling 100% right about my decisions.

Hold on to the small, familiar things and please, let go of the guilt. Holding onto it only serves to add trauma to this terrible world tragedy. Hope this extra time is giving you the chance to enjoy your hobbiesit's therapeutic and absolutely essential.","7"

I had a friend who was an amateur body builder. He was around 6""4, about 285 lbs, without a pound of fat on him and strong as a bull. He almost turned a car over once on his own on a dare. I've seen him move refrigerators on his own, washer / dryer units, etcetera. A good guy to have if you are going into a rough neighborhood or club. Anyway, although he's a very kind hearted guy, he also likes to party with bikers and get in brawls with people he doesn't like (usually people who have attitudes or are racist toward him). We drifted apart because he had a habit of getting police attention for obvious reasons. Nice guy. Sweet guy. But a magnet for trouble. I stopped hanging out with him as I matured. 

On the flip side, I had a friend once whose father was a judge and they lived in a multi-million dollar estate with a house that had an elevator in it. He was arrogant, saw people as tools to be used, but had connections to everyone in town and he once told me that he and his family could literally do anything and be above the law. He was probably right. Girls really dug him. He had money to do anything at any time. If he liked you, your life was easy. If he didn't like you, he could ruin your future and he knew that and loved it. After knowing him for a year or two, I stopped talking to him. He dragged me down emotionally and spiritually. 

Friends define the person, and as you mature and grow, they should grow with you. 

As far as vaccination, in the US it's largely political I think. We have a potentially deadly pandemic that's wiped out over 720,000 US lives, far more than the pandemic of 1918 at this point and the numbers are still going up. There's a vaccination that is free, safe, vetted by the FDA and CDC, and can save your life and those of others. The only reason not to get it is you believe it's a conspiracy, don't care about your health or others, or want to oppose the system, or don't understand. I personally could not be friends with someone who doesn't care, doesn't understand, or wants to potentially risk their life and those of others to make a point. 

If I were in your shoes, I'd look at this person, give them sympathy but also see they're dragging down my own ability and disposition and putting others health at risk to make some kine of ego-driven point, or don't understand, or don't care. I'd offer to be supportive, encourage them to get vaccinated and improve their lives and help society overall, slowly remove myself, and find friends who share life values and goals.","3"

If it's any consolation, in regards to your comment, the nature of viruses means that mutations are far more likely to make the virus less deadly than to make it worse. A lot of things have to line up perfectly for it to get worse, whereas any number of things can make a virus ineffective or less dangerous. This is a different virus to spanish flu as well, so it's very possible that it won't behave the same way in terms of a second wave, not to mention the foresight and medical knowledge we have now means that we're extremely unlikely to see a similar pattern that we saw over 100 years ago.

A month ago, we dealt with this exact scenario. He thought he had a cold, next morning he had body chills and fever. He did a PCR test and we did an at home rapid test. As soon as the rapid test came back positive, I grabbed my toiletries, threw some clothes in a laundry hamper and relocated to our home office where I worked and slept. He isolated in our bedroom that has an attached bath for 10 days (10 days from onset of symptoms). I brought him food and anything he needed. I just wore a KN95 mask when I brought him things, but we kept at least 6 feet apart and kept face to face interactions short. I took a PCR test 5 days after my last unmasked/close contact with him, and it was negative. I still quarantined for a total of 10 days from the date of last close contact and was mindful of any symptoms, but I never had any. 

To add another layer, we have kids too young to be vaccinated that had close contact with him at the very onset of his symptoms, before he had a fever. They also tested negative and did not get sick.

Isolation worked for us. It helped that he had his own separate bathroom. 

He had fever and felt achy for a couple of days, but that was the worst of it for him symptom-wise.

He came out of his room a couple of times, just for his own sanity. When he did, he would wash his hands, wear a mask, keep distant from us, he usually just walked out to the back porch to sit in a different setting. I would use sanitizing wipes on all surfaces he came near and just kind of wiped all high touch surfaces a few times a day. I think him being vaccinated helped in both keeping his symptoms mild and helping him not be as contagious for as long as he would have been unvaccinated. 

My vaccinated neighbors had gone through this in August, and the sick person isolated the same way my husband did and they too were able to keep from passing it on the the other, so I modeled our isolation after what they did.

There is a big window in the bedroom where he stayed and just opening the blinds and watching the daily movements in our neighborhood helped. He FaceTimed with the kids and with friends, too.

Day 1 (a Monday), he developed a dry cough. We completely exposed each other the entire evening after he had gone to work. He works in a small office and nobody wore masks at the time since everyone was fully vaccinated. Day 2, he stays home as he starts feeling a cold coming on. He feels pretty fatigued. I go to work that day and find out a friend we hung out with the previous Friday just tested positive as a breakthrough. That evening, he tests positive. Again, we were not wearing masks around each other. I started wearing a medical mask, nothing too fancy/robust. He sleeps on the couch and I sleep on the bed. The following day, I go to an Airbnb for 3 nights just to give my husband space as we live in a one bedroom apartment. I test negative that Wednesday but decide to quarantine and stay home from work anyway. I come by around noon every day for the next 1-2 days to check on him and bring him food.

Never tested positive or developed symptoms. Husband lost sense of smell and developed a fever for about a day or so. Didnt start to feel better until 6 days after the onset of symptoms. 

So moral of the story, unless your spouse tests positive, create as much distance as you can from your spouse! Wear masks around each other. Open windows, quarantine in opposite parts of your home or get a hotel/Airbnb nearby if financially possible for a few nights. Good luck!

Also, I would recommend your wife to stay home from work if financially possible as well for at least 5 working days, in case she gets sick and especially if she works with at-risk people.","2"

People have made it a sport to talk shit to each other on that game. I also enjoy Overwatch, but the community there is similar. If you find a group of people that you enjoy playing with then the jerks are less bothersome. But in competitive games people can be jerks. 

There are some good cooperative games like Diablo III, Left 4 Dead 2, Borderlands 3, Deep Rock Galactic, Vermintide 2, World War Z, Division 2, Conan Exiles, Valheim - where it's you and your team against the game rather than against another team. Not entirely relaxing but you don't have to worry about toxic competitors. Stardew Valley, Satisfactory, and No Mans Sky might be relaxing. It really depends on the style of games you like. I recommend trying a variety and finding out what you like, if you don't already know. 

For me, it's more about the people I play with than the game. There are games that I like better than others, but I've tried a lot of new games just because my gaming friends wanted to play them and I've been surprised that I've actually grown to like some games I never thought I would (COD for example - never in a million years thought I would like it and now it's one of my favorite games).

0.1% across all people in that age group, these stats include people with pre-existing conditions and all levels of health. Even if your husband was an alcoholic and current smoker his risk of death would still be exceptionally low (obviously it would be higher and risk of severe disease would be higher). Your anxiety is extremely unlikely to influence your odds of severe disease in any significant way as well, everyone is anxious right now.

Your husband sounds like he is taking all the precautions he can, so his risk of even catching it is low. But rest assured that it is REMARKABLY UNLIKELY that he will die of this virus if he does catch it.","2"

I wrote this How-to-Survive the Coronavirus Crisis article for people like you who are wondering what to do, and are in fear for themselves and their family or friends.

I'm in Bangladesh which is not the worst place to be, to be honest, but not the most convenient either. The organisation takes all responsibility for my well being and I raised this concern + have been pushing for flexible hours since November.

Thankfully my paranoia made sure I got answers to all the worst case scenarios my brain could come up with before I left, which is how we were equipped to handle this. I don't know if it'll make a difference to the back-to- normal policy but we can hope. 

It is recommended to quarantine when I get back as well, and I'm absolutely going to do that, no question. If I ever get back I mean.","1_1"

The key now is distraction. Weirdly, this is actually fighting the battle at hand, which is anxiety. If you get covid symptoms, you will deal with them when you get there. Think of anything that is legal and safe that you can do to distract yourself from worrying about whether you'll get symptoms. Trash TV. Audiobooks. Laundry. Folding clothes really nicely. Bubble baths, horticulture, video games, skyping loved ones, doing push ups, scooping up ice cream with Doritos, maybe even doing work, whatever floats your boat, There is no such thing as a guilty pleasure. Work put you in this position. Self isolation is a huge sacrifice to the safety of others. What you do in here is your damn business.","1_1_1"

so as a bit of reassurance i believe if you just take your vitamins, expose yourself to the sun for a fair bit (for vitamin D), get proper sleep etc., sanitize and always wear a mask, you may be good. again, it never hurts to be cautious, but i do believe it shouldn't debilitate us from going outside for NECESSARY activities as long as we're careful.

You are describing severe health anxiety for which you need to reach out to counselling (professional) to help you overcome - you recognize that your behaviour isn't good for your mental health and that's the first step. Now try to take more.

To add to that, the possibility of being a breakthrough case, sent us right back into panic mode. We find it difficult to lean into the protection provided by our vaccines because we are afraid that we might fall ill and even worse, we might pass it on to our family and friends. I agree with one of the comments that addressed this perfectly - Be smart, but live your life. The first step to that is getting accurate information about the risk of breakthrough covid-19. As per current data, theres less than a 1 percent chance of experiencing a breakthrough case  its anywhere between 1 in 5000 to 1 in 13000. Furthermore, most breakthrough cases are very mild and the need for emergency care in such cases is extremely rare (almost completely among the immunocompromised and the elderly). You can [check out this link for more info](https://www.everydayhealth.com/coronavirus/breakthrough-covid-19-whats-the-real-risk/) on the risk of breakthrough covid-19  the article also contains links to the most recent studies so that you have a clear idea of the real risks of breakthrough cases.    
There are also many instances where people have been exposed to the covid-19 virus within the 14-day window after their second shot. These are not really breakthrough cases since it takes about 14 days after your second shot for your immune system to do its thing. Many people go out to celebrate their second shot as soon as they get it and land up falling ill which makes them believe that vaccines dont work. Also, we keep seeing news reports about the rise in covid-19 cases across every state which is quite alarming. However, it is important to note that this increase is not in breakthrough cases but rather due to the disease spreading among the unvaccinated. In fact, the White House Covid Response team said that this outbreak is becoming 'a pandemic of unvaccinated' since more than 90% of all hospital admissions and deaths are now among those who have not got their shots. Since youre worried about getting a breakthrough infection, you can stick to meeting your friends who have been completely vaccinated. It may take a while for you to work past the anxiety you feel after socializing, so maybe you can start with shorter interactions with smaller groups. You can [check this link for the current](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html) guidelines for fully vaccinated people for a better idea of which types of social interactions have a negligible to low risk and which ones have a higher risk. Isolating yourself may seem like a viable better safe than sorry approach but this comes at a tremendous cost to your mental health. You can take small steps to slowly expand your comfort zone - even if its something as simple as a daily walk or cycling with a friend. All the best.","14"

She would drink from my water bottle even though I asked her not to. I thought I would FOR SURE be a breakthrough case. My husband too. How could we not with the amount of exposure we had. We got tested and everything and were negative the whole time! Just cool to see how well the vaccine did its job. We both were vaccinated this Spring, so several months ago. I think you should feel comfortable going out and living your life being vaccinated. You could wear a kn95 mask or something with extra protection and have sanitizer extra handy - that might ease your anxiety. But like others said, your anxiety is valid. This delta wave has been awful mentally/emotionally.","15"

I kind of understand how you feel career wise.  I have had setbacks in my hospitality career and am currently going through one right now with the Pandemic.   I currently just switched career fields and in my job search I was always look for jobs that were within my skill set. So because I was in hospitality I looked for something customer focused and because I was a manager I looked for something that would allow me to use my multi tasking and management skills.  So my advice is to evaluate what your skills and look for jobs and look for jobs that cater to those particular skills.  Also resume help from a peer is key! 

&amp;#x200B;

For the apartment search I don't know what city you are in but have you ever tried an apartment locator?  Some companies like Smart City advertise on Instagram. I have used an apartment locator the last couple of times I have had to move and they are amazing and free to use!!  When you call them they  usually ask you about budget and what area you would like to live in and any other detailed questions to help narrow down the search and then on a day that you are free they setup tours for you to look at the apartments.  They do the legwork for you and you don't even have to pay them because they work off of commission.

It is VERY well funded (over and on top of tuition fees). The current president is young, he's not going anywhere, and all he cares about is the music department. He *pours* massive amounts of money into it every year (often pissing off parents who would rather some of those funds were put toward bringing the kids into NYC regularly to train them in ""urban life""). The music department is phenomenal, fully connected to the community, and it's a beautiful example of humanities education really working; I've gone to a number of performances there and have frequently used their practice rooms. Covid forced Bard to send all their kids home. But Bard is not going awayeven if they have to virtualize all the classes. And that president is not going away, either. I know your teaching credential might not easily transfer to NYS, and I know there are a zillion teaching opportunities in Boston and MA, but from what I know about schools in Boston and NYC, none other can touch this level of financial dedication (except maybe Berklee School of Music, but that's a dedicated music school).

ALSO, right across the Hudson River from Bard is Kingston, NY, a great, growing city with extremely low rents in decent areas (I looked at a 1200 sq ft 2-bedroom just outside of town that was going for I think $1100 or $1200 a year ago). Room shares in Kingston go for about $700 for a 150-200 sq ft room. Kingston also has probably the biggest gig economy in Hudson Valley. I know nearly 50 people in that area that get by on next to nothing (i.e., monthly income of $2000-ish).

Obviously a long shot. But you're a music teacher, this place has tons of money, and the quality of life in the area is to die for. I met a fairly rich couple in Western Mass a year ago who were very jealous of me living in HV. They were from Boston and had a kid attending Bard, so they knew MA and HV really well. They weren't into music, tho, so they were rather pissed at Bard and getting ready to move their daughter to a different school.","6"

If it brings you any solace, my birthday is also coming up. These are crazy times we're living in but I'm learning to focus on the things that I'm grateful for, even if they are not ""big"" things. Do you have anything in your surroundings that you love? A pet? A favorite book? Favorite song? Try to revisit the feeling you had when you first received these things. For me, I listen to old songs that bring back good memories. It feels like taking a temporary vacation from all of this drama. 

When times get tough, I find that it helps to give back in some way. Maybe find an online volunteer group or compliment 5 people every day. Your friends don't seem like real friends. Think of some hobbies that you would like to explore after this is all over. Learn more about the hobbies and then join groups to meet like-minded new people. 

From your post, I can gather a few things that you can express gratitude for: 

\- Working from home - there's so many unemployed and struggling people right now (me being one of those people!). Please cherish having a job, especially during these times when everything is so unpredictable. Your job can offer a sense of stability. 

\- Basic necessities - again, it's not big when you think of it, but it *is* big and a blessing.

\- Life - you mentioned that no one would care if you died. I say, ""who cares?!"" At least you're still alive and kicking. This is your chance to use every moment to learn, grow, and improve as a person (oh, and to get away from those who don't care about you!)

I know that you might not want to hear these things and they might be cliche but I just wanted you to know that you're definitely not alone. I'm feeling the same way at times, it's tough. But you have to rediscover your purpose and make this moment fun and worthwhile. Look at this time as a moment, because it will go by fast.","7"

And I understand that having been through a depression, you must be observing every little valley with the fear of a bottomless hole ahead of you but remember that the need for extra rest, is natural for the body after any big stress event. 

You have been drained of energy and during the daytime, our brains are unable to clean out the used resources, which is possible for the rest of our bodies. During proper sleep periods, our system opens up the pathways inside our brains and literally flush it through with fluids that removes spent resources. The rest of our bodies can do that throughout the entire daytime with no problems. You probably also need time to do alittle soul searching in a time like this. That you are younger may even heighten that need, since you have had much shorter time, to think about what life means to you than us older folks. Try to sleep more if you feel that underlying exhaustion (and use an eyemask to cover your eyes so the light doesn't disturb your sleep regardless what time of day that you do sleep). Going from needing 8hours to 10hours is 100% normal and after your system rinse through, you'll feel better. 

Imagine the people who lived through 5 years of war. How did they feel after 1 year and what do you need to do, to not be broken before 2 years have passed and find things to pass time with so it doesn't become like torture. When people die, there is just nothing more to do. Let people know that you hope to get endlessly more time with them because you love them so much and prepare for the worse while hoping for the best. Your pain over this situation isn't small or unimportant. Everybody suffers something here, regardless if they are alone and missing out on opportunities that they could have had or if they have a unite of people that they fear losing. You understand that other people have already suffered more than your family, so you are mature and have morals and you suffer, because of the understanding of what this is costing you and what it might cost you. The entire world needs you to be able to survive this, both mentally and physically. Remember that when you don't feel strong, you just aren't feeling strong right now. Stay away from those doctors and hospitals, they are disease ridden plague-holes and unless you need them to not die, just stay away from them for now. Get some sleep and do some soul-searching and cling like mad to any habits that helps you pass time and be alive! Talking with other people, even people online, is super healthy and perhaps you can spend some time chatting with other people who are also feeling upset about the situation in front of us all. All that matters is to keep the virus concentration down. Best wishes to you and your loved ones and thank you for sharing with us. If you keep looking for it, there will come a new day eventually.","3"

You are a human being. You are scared. You deserve to live and be happy. We all do. And we are all terrified.

Second off, being ""fat"" is definitely ""unhealthy,"" for the most part. But its just perverse how much shame is placed on it. We live in a world where most of us have to constantly think about not getting fat in order to stay thin given common fat/calorie content of processed and prepared food. I've been overweight, if not ""fat,"" and sometimes found the shame almost crippling. But, again, you've done absolutely nothing wrong. You live in a world where gaining weight is just what happens naturally if you don't practically fight not to.

Third off, **listen to your doctor** they know far more about how the body works and what to be concerned about than 99% of people writing here. If you're working out and losing weight, you are already building a better working body and a healthier blood pressure. Think of that work and the direction you are heading in as preparation if, god forbid and knock on wood, you do have the misfortune to contract COVID. 

I live in Louisiana and the past few days, NOLA has been the source of alot of stories about Obesity+COVID=death and, well, that leaves out ALOT. The real story is more like: obesity is associated with a huge plethora of chronic health problems associated with southern urban poverty. It is that plethora which explains not only the mortality but the greater likelihood of contraction in the first place.

If anything, you're *slightly* higher risk than certain other people your age, but that just means that maybe instead of a 0.02% chance of fatality (based on your age range), you have like a 0.03% chance or something.

My advice is to cut out the extra hours if you dont need the money, and get together with whoever is up for an outdoor activity. As far as daycare goes, I personally had my 4 year old in three hour a day preschool (after much deliberation) and she got a lot out of it this year.

If you are 30 and don't have any health issues, covid should not be such a worry for you. Get your vaccines, wear a mask in risky places (transports, doctor's appointments etc) but otherwise you just have to accept covid is one of the diseases that exist, like the flu, stomach flu and other diseases which are very unpleasant but part of life.

I think the initial strategy of waiting for things to get better is no longer applicable as it seems it will never go away now. Just have to live with it and be careful when relevant.

Firstly, though I was never as serious as you about lockdown, I too feel like I've time travelled a few years. But not in a cool way. Also I was in a cult last 6 years and especially integrated into it last few years. I got out a few months ago, thank God. Here I am a little balder, no less broke, still no real friends, and only that much closer to old age. I'm estranged from my evangelist family at this point, so I'm definitely super alone in this, plus I live in my car! Enough to make you bummed out about shit. When I first busted out of the cult and made it back to where I was living and working before, I was feeling a little hopeless, a little bit like everything is kind of pointless... Tbh, it's just a funk. You gotta just shake it off, do all the things you know you should be doing, and most importantly making friends with yourself. That last bit is key.

 I went the whole last two years never catching it. I finally got it earlier this month. I was super worried about it turning into long covid but sure enough once I tested negative on day 12 I was on an epic upswing as of that day. It never turned into long covid. It really comes down to how good of shape you're in and age. If you're overweight, I highly recommend making it a priority to lose it, and get into good shape. Get super active =M<ü","4"

Moved out on my own last year, been super careful, get groceries delivered, I don't go out where there's a lot of people, quit the gym, started working out at home, work remotely as well.

I noticed wow, there's a lot I do on my own alone at home now. I go for runs outside, but I avoid trails where I might be near others. I also read a lot of threads on Reddit about Covid. Most of the time, these threads are from people and about articles so far from where I live in situations so completely different from my own.

I also notice that a lot of the fear I have around covid in general is generated by anecdotes of people on here. ""Sick as a dog"", ""Flattened me for days"", ""Worst sore throat of my life"", ""Six months of no smell"", ""Fatigue and brain fog since 2020"", ""Insomnia for weeks"", ""I'm fully vaccinated, live like a hermit and I'm terrified of long covid"". All from people with 3, 4 shots. Sound familiar? It makes me miserable reading this so I've limited how much browsing I do here now. This place isn't representative of reality, and neither are peoples anecdotes about the virus

Maybe you'll get it, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll suffer long covid, maybe you won't. Unfortunately we just can't get that assurance we'll be 100% ok. Uncertainty is scary. We assume the worst is true and will happen. Worrying about the what ifs and possibilities is like worrying about your house burning down. You can worry so much in advance of it happening that you make yourself sick, and what about when it happens? You deal with it in the moment using the same resources you always had.

That's what's been helping me recently. I've been telling myself long covid isn't a certainty, it doesn't do me any good to worry in advance of getting it, and even if I did get it, and I mean the things that scare me most: fatigue, brain fog, insomnia, loss of smell and taste for months I believe I can handle it and would recover. There's also a reason so much of the general public appears so careless about the whole thing. People have weighed the risks and make their choices. There's something to be said for that as well whether you feel it's wrong or right.

If you're not comfortable doing certain things now, then when? What would it take? Is it worth putting things off indefinitely due to an uncertainty of some hypothetical worst case scenario? I'm not telling you to be careless and go all in. Things are still very hard for me and I'm only just now considering testing the waters a bit but I think it's important to be aware of how you're thinking about things and how that translates into your actions around all this. There's obviously a part of you yearning for some change, and a bit of experimentation might help a bit with this.","5"

Namely me. I get very brash and angry while panicked, but its not a reason to be abusive and nasty. 

Your husband is definitely suffering severe anxiety and panic right now. We all are in some way, some of us worse than others, and even though its nice that youre so understanding of this for him, he has to have control over his own reactionsotherwise he is just completely toxic, and at the end of the day, that is NOT your problem or responsibly to deal with. Its his and his alone. 

We are all going through something. Im early thirties and had covid badly in April, got pneumonia and everything. Luckily I survived it, but the world is still a messed up place. Bad leadership from our government. Mixed messaging. Job loss. I dont have a job. My mom doesnt have a job. Were having to still live together because its the only way well both survive, financially, but thats not going to last forever either! 

I would recommend he go to therapy. I see you dont want to rock the boat and make him more angry, but what kind of marriage do you have if you cant talk about this openly and intimately to release some fear and tension. Thats a horrible marriage. I would be really direct about your emotions with him and tell him that youre not going to be treated this way, its a hard time for you, too. He needs to seek therapy ASAP or itll get more out of control than it already is. 

I dont know where you live, but masks + distancing is pretty much 99% safe. The way your grandma went to get her hair done, the way you sat in the car and handled it is exactly what youre supposed to be doing. Was she wearing a mask? If grandma doesnt wear a mask, I would not do anymore errands with her, or ask that she do when youre together. Everyone in my family wears a mask. We recently had to be around each other because my family member was in the hospital (unrelated to covid). 

When I had covid, I went to the hospital. Twice. It didnt matter FOR ME because I had the virus. The only people at risk while in the hospital regarding covid are the medical personnel. And what he said about not visiting you in the hospital: 1, he probably wouldnt be able to because of the way laws are with covid and, 2, is just ridiculously insensitive. My mother took care of me the entire time I was sick. She knew her risks and we were as careful as humanly possible and thankfully she was fine. 

I wouldnt be so brash because I dont know you, but if I was you, Id think REALLY hard about spending my life with this person who allows their fear to make them a step away from sociopath. 

Distance for the two weeks of being with grandma, if hes so scared, but after that, i dont know. I would think real long and hard about what I want for my life, especially during a crisis. Life is full ofem!! Good luck.","1"

Is there anything you want to do as a response? My first thought is that some couples counseling could be a good thing (and given that it's probably all over video right now, could be an easier sell for him). It's okay to be worried, but really isn't okay for him to treat you the way he is.

Try to start with this book:

https://thewellnesssociety.org/free-coronavirus-anxiety-workbook/

Sit down with him and read through it together. Discuss it with him. If he won't see you for three days use this time to build up some facts - how many cases are there in your area? A lot, or hardly any? 

What precautions did the salon/you/your grandmother take - talk him through these and how each reduces any risk of infection if the hairstylist was infected (which she probably wasn't). Talk him through the risk of death to healthy people in your age group, which is very small. Explain to him why all this makes his behaviour unreasonable.

I would suggest then trying to set some activities to help him deal with his fears - plan a visit to a supermarket and talk about what could go wrong, how you would deal with it and so on. However, it's clear from what you say that his health anxiety is long-standing and deep seated. He needs professional help to deal with that.

The children have gone back to school this week and it's really messed with my partner, so I really empathise with your situation.

It's extremely isolating, so I'd say the main thing for you is to try to keep in really regular contact with friends and family if you can. Phonecalls and video calls rather than text messaging make a big difference and you need somewhere to vent your frustrations.

Yes everyone is catching omicron now. It's so infectious its effectively rendered most restrictions totally useless even. But its a much milder variant, add that to vaccinations and you have a very positive picture of a relatively benign winter virus that we can live with.

Theres nothing to be ashamed about trying to live more normally and ending up catching omicron.

But for me it's the no contact check ins. I am diabetic and just not sure if this is safe enough. We don't plan on making contact with anyone on the way but there's always that chance of an accident or medical emergency (our oldest often gets respiratory issues in winter that have at times required an ER visit - do not want to be stuck in the middle of nowhere looking for urgent care...). There's no way of knowing for sure. But even with our risks we are leaning more and more toward that plan. We would travel from the west to northeast and it will take at least a week so several overnights with two littles. We have even considered booking the Airbnbs for a few days before we actually arrive to have 48-72 hours between stays. We have been working and schooling from home since early March and have not entered any retail stores or restaurants - only interaction has been doctor/dentist as necessary. If we do this we will also be getting Covid tests prior to leaving. I don't think it's crazy but the stop to see family might be dangerous. We, too, were thinking of stopping to see my dad along the way but I told him we would truly only stand out in the yard more than 6 ft apart with masks, no hugging.

The second one in particular explains why misinterpreting the data makes the situation look worse than it is.

""The bottom line is that deltaa variant with distinct mutations making it much more transmissible, blunting immune protection as much as 10-foldposes a challenge to the vaccines currently used. But in most people the vaccine induced levels of neutralising antibodies are large enough that even a 10-fold drop keeps them well protected.
So, while its sobering to see cases occurring in fully vaccinated people, their protection is holding up well, as judged by numbers of hospital admissions and fatalities relative to what might have been.""","1_1_2_1_2_1"

If everyone does what they can, it will have a big impact. A lot of folks are WFH in the Seattle area even though they have good reason to think that they, personally, are low risk. The reason is to slow the spread from people with few to no symptoms (yet) who don't realize that they have COVID-19. Even if many people get this disease in the end, we can reduce the strain on our hospitals by spreading out the length of time when people get sick - so the 20% with serious illness get the best care possible.

Like you, Im not looking to be a part of that covid population either; Ive been in the house for a couple of weeks now and am running out of tp.  Am I happy? No; but Im not letting myself get down on being cooped up.  I will make the best of a crappy situation(pun intended).  One silver lining is that Im going to be a lot more lean after all of this since Ive been rationing my food stuffs to the best of my desires.  Ive got books, paper and pen for journaling my experience through this historic event, and you and other redditors for bouncing ideas around with.
I imagine Ill try to fashion some sort of face mask when I venture out for food resupply.  I will bring my elderly neighbors any supplies they may need but let them tell me how theyd like me to deliver it so we can hopefully meet all of our own anti-germ-spread ideas.
If/When I do get sick Ill pray to my God that it be minor and self-isolate even harder.  Will I die? Yes, eventually, but Im still relatively young and relatively healthy and Im mindful that the odds are with me especially if I practice reasonable precautions while in the community. 

I do wish you success in avoiding contracting a serious case of COVID-19 ( or any other illness thatll need medical attention).  Keep up your personal hygiene practices and cut out any activities that may cause injury ( ie use butter knives to cut food instead of steak knives., keep anything flammable away from heat sources, keep all your daily food stuffs and household items down low so you dont need to reach up high or use stools).

Unfortunately, I don't currently have any firearms, but I do have a fair amount of melee weapons. And my picks.

The prescriptions are kinda meh. I need more in about a month and a half on essential meds. 2 weeks on ""not very essential"". I'm hoping they'll deliver, but otherwise it's drivethrough in a mask and gloves and taking the prescription bag in a plastic bag and isolating it.

You keep foodstuff at eye level. Bending down is when you hit your head. That and the toilet or shower. I took my hanging lights up years ago. Shower chair is a good idea too, or at least a mat.

To get ""a reliable website to suggest this specifically for coronavirus"" you would logically need to have run tests over many patients and months and establish pros/cons a protocol.

This is advised all over for web for such things as ""...temporary infections, such as [pneumonia](https://www.healthline.com/health/pneumonia). If you have a bad [cold](https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-flu/head-cold) or [flu](https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-flu/flu), you can also use postural drainage to help keep mucus out of your lungs."" - [https://www.healthline.com/health/postural-drainage](https://www.healthline.com/health/postural-drainage)   


Considering that COVID causes pneumonia, I think there's a good enough of a train of logic to do this - especially when no other medical intervention is available because your local hospital is 10x over capacity.

However, if you have mild/typical diarrhea, then that's probably due to stress and anxiety (stress pooping is a thing for those of us with anxiety disorders!). I am an anxiety-ridden person myself, and anxiety can cause all of those symptoms you're describing. So as someone with an anxiety disorder, let me tell you how it went down for me.

My diarrhea was flat-out the worst of my life, and started last Tuesday night (of last week) very suddenly, and still hasn't let up (and I mean, my body has churned everything to liquid). This is the kind of diarrhea that you struggle to stay hydrated because you're losing so much liquid from the rear hatch that you can't replace it fast enough. The kind of diarrhea that makes you weak and dizzy because you're losing so many electrolytes. And it just. Won't. Stop. No medicine will touch it. I also had intense stomach pain, like a combination of heartburn and a deep stabbing sensation, like I'd been punched or stabbed. These were not like stomach cramps or gas. This pain was very different. 

Unless your diarrhea is on that scale, I wouldn't worry about it. The doctors in China and Italy talked about ""severe"" gastrointestinal distress being a potential symptom. And lordy, they weren't kidding about that ""severe"" part.

So that started suddenly on Tuesday night. Then the cough/chest stuff started Sunday, and got worse pretty quickly through the day. The fever was present when I woke up on Monday. 

Everyone is presenting differently, it seems. It's a little ironic in my case, though. I was so afraid of catching it, yet all the while I was suffering from the gastrointestinal stuff, I didn't suspect for a moment that I'd caught it. I was like, ""Well, I caught something else, but at least it's not COVID!"" I'd stayed home from the moment the stomach problems started until the cough began, so I know I didn't pick it up in between. I didn't learn until halfway through my week of gastric hell that what I was experiencing was, in fact, a possible symptom of COVID-19. And that's when my anxiety kicked in, lol.

My doctor is fighting to get me tested, as I was turned away for not having traveled to Europe/China and not being 65+ (not a lot of tests here). She's 100% convinced I have it, and I agree. And just like OP said, it's really not like anything I've had before. It's not like a flu, or a respiratory infection. It's it own special misery and it feels very different. 

I know telling you not to worry won't help, because it didn't help me either before I actually got sick. Anxiety sucks. :( I wish I could offer you words of comfort  Now that I'm sick, though, I'm a lot more zen about it, because what will happen will happen, and I can stop worrying about catching it now. I mean, I'm miserable and sick, and I'm not having fun, but... I don't know. All I can do is take care of myself now. Instead of fearing every person I see, or being terrified to go outside, or staring at every common surface with dread, now I'm quarantined and I have only one job: monitoring myself. That I can do. That's easier than fearing all the viral dangers outside, and trying to stay ahead of every person who might cough in my direction. 

All I can suggest is to stay at home if you can. That's really your only sure-fire way of protection. Try some deep breathing, and maybe meditation? Or if you're religious, maybe some prayerful meditation. When I'm so anxious I can't stand it, meditation is about the only thing that helps. It's a struggle to get into that quiet mindset, but it's worth the struggle because it helps. Try the apps One Moment Meditation, or Headspace (they are a paid service, but they have daily free meditations). I always have to use a guide to meditate.

We are living in trying times indeed,every human on the globe has been impacted by this in one way or other.

I relate to most of your anxieties and they are perfectly healthy responses we are evolved to have.

For example I see the fear in peoples eyes when I walk the streets to get from A to B.

I have been working non stop since the initial Wuhan outbreak working in a support role to outbreak intelligence efforts,I also have my dark hours where especially the asymptomatic spread combined with an abnormally long incubation period are really liable to mess with ones head.

I have been self isolating as much as possible doing as much work I can remotely(which is a surprising amount it turns out).

I sometimes feel psychosomatic symptoms when I am stressed,but then I realize that's what it is.

&amp;#x200B;

The stigmatization get exacerbated by the (unwarranted)guilt one feels about it ,somethings that helps here I have found from others in your situation (and me too with extra time I have),is to try

finding ways to help others having a hard time of it with this whole situation and help volunteering in other ways have been very effective in alleviating stress symptoms and guilt

as well as being good for your mental well being in general.

&amp;#x200B;

Hereunder in no particular order:(ways that I have found effective in assisting people)

1.Assisting people that are less technically inclined setting up crowdfunding projects for sick relatives or COVID19 related hardships in general.

2. Help raising money,buy on international mkt or get these from non essential places(dentists,beauty Spas etc) for PPE equipment and get them to your nearest ER.

3.Reach out to people that need support as much as you can,educate yourself as much as you can using the authoritative resources out there,like CDC,WHO etc.

4.I had an idea the other day,since the bulk of the first wave is coming,maybe start a sub reddit for people that  are feeling symptoms and dont not what to do,dont get a real response since the system is under pressure or have difficulties navigating their way to it.This in order to alliviate stress on health services in general and will have a global outreach,using CDC,WHO and local guidelines from where the person is located.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to volunteer I would be happy to have you.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want somebody to talk to,you can direct message me if you like,and Ill give you an   email adress you can reach me at 24/7.

But I disagree with your assertion that it is not a Chinese disease. It originated in the wet markets of Wuhan due to wildlife smuggling there. This already happened once before with SARS in 2003, and we as a worldwide society need to accept that risky practices such as wildlife smuggling and the consumption of exotic meats such as bat meat and pangolin meat are completely and unacceptably risky, in order to prevent it from ever happening again. Obviously most ordinary Chinese people had nothing to do with this, and they actually were the first people affected by it, but that doesn't change the fact the country they are from has serious problems with zoonotic transmission of viruses, and resulting pandemics. If this was occurring in the country I lived in, I'd want the rulers of the country to be held responsible, as well as the wildlife smugglers themselves.

Not to mention that people do spread and transmit the virus, particularly if they ignore medical advice on self-isolation, etc.

We need to focus on beating this disease and avoiding further outbreaks, not obsessing over the ways to be the most politically correct.","22"

&gt;STIGMA - It's almost as bad as the virus itself. I feel embarrassed, I feel ashamed, I feel like I didn't socially distance well enough, I feel like I can't tell my friends or my coworkers. I don't want their judgment. Social media shamers have made it worse (people who mean well but are posting things that are deeply stigmatizing) - it creates an ""us vs them"" environment. Please be kind with your language.

Something I've noticed is that, generally (at least in my part of the world), language like this is referring to people who blatantly disregard physical distancing and don't self-isolate. *Not* the general population of people who are sick with covid-19 and self-isolating. *Not* the people who have taken measures to keep themselves and others safe to the best of their ability. Talking about transmitting the virus and other things is about those who consider the world to be overreacting and refuse to sacrifice their way of life, business, or anything else for the common good. 

Be compassionate to yourself, there was no way to know who had it if they were asymptomatic. I'm glad you know where you got it, but at the time there was nothing more you could have done. You are getting the medical help you need, you are safe, and you are protecting others as much as you can. Feel pride for the actions you have taken and the risk you have mitigated for others. Your friends and co-workers likely will want to support you, even in gesture; and if they don't.... They are assholes. There's no way around that. Anyone who gets mad at someone for contracting a virus unknowingly and following medical advice is just not worth your time or energy. You are amazing for your resiliency.","41"

And remember: there's a difference between someone who is actively endangering others by not practicing social distancing, good hygiene, or has symptoms of covid-19 but refuses to isolate ... And someone who is practicing these things to mitigate risk for everyone. Focus on this difference when you are part of discussions or see it on social media.

The shame is real, though. Right now I'm going back and forth between thinking: if it's negative, then I wasted all this time and created worry and panic at my workplace for no reason.

Unless we take the antibody test which is being rolled out, we'll probably never know if we had it, for sure. I've got underlying health problems so am self-isolating, just in case. 

I hope you get better very soon - I hope and pray that the planet can get on top of this virus. Stay safe everyone!","47"

You are not guilty of contracting the virus, you had no choice in that. The important thing is telling people who should be made aware about an exposure, as that is a choice that affects others. Being able to trace the contact back to a known case is a prerequisite for testing in most places.

It's so very fitting, as what is currently occurring has no precedence for frame of reference within our global society's modern collective memory. Disparity and hate within our society is being laid bare and clear, far more vividly than nominal levels generally permit, though sickening that it be an accepted norm at all. Given now, in these unusually long moments, I think the solitary time so many of us find ourselves thrust into should not be squandered or taken for granted, but instead used for imagination, meditation, and revelation. The people we become and find ourselves to be on the far side of this circumstance can be better. We can be kinder. We can release greed, and we can be more tolerant. Simple changes like these, rooted in the minds of many amidst such frightening times as these have the ability to sprout into hope and create a new beautiful reality for us all to realize.","53"

I'm a currently in the same situation. I work for an Airline I have no idea when I even got it, I wash, wipe and distance as much as o coul i went nowhere besides work home and the gocery store. It's so scary ingot a fever on Monday and I've been home since. This is day 5 and inswewr I've ready every article or blog trying to figure out how bad I am. I took the test yesterday and the waiting game is just so stressful. I like u worry that I could have given it to the guy I'm dating, we spent a day together and I had no idea I I thought I was coming down from a cold which I normally get at least 3 times in the winter months. How are you feeling now? I am not normally a written on line, mostly a reader, but I have to say every chance inget i let ppl know my progression with this virus. Sidebar, none of this is your fault. I have a hard time finding stories of people speaking on their symptoms because they're scared of what others think. We need to know others stores and symptoms so we can protect ourselves and be more aware so we dont spread it. I'm almost 100% I have it, my doctor also said pretty much the same. I had low grade fever Monday and Tuesday, on tues instated reading about not being able to smell, well I smelt everything in my house with scent and could smell nothing. Come Thursday I felt a little soar throat and a burning in my chest, I immediately went toy doctor. I have no underlying health issues that I know off, I recently did an check up but I am what they would consider overweight,  probably by the height weight chart obese. So that has worried. So I went to the doctor he hard me breathing in and out, said my lungs were fine. I dont know how secure I felt but I had the test administered and came home. Today Friday inalsonwoke up little heavy on my chest and still the burning sensation. I'm so scared because I'm only 37 and at that age many of us dont think about we may be slowly dying.

However, were having to completely redo everything we have done beforein class activities that are quick and easy in person have to be structured for a remote environment.  Ive caught myself saying last year we did this and then I realize that not only do my students not care what I did last year, it actually might be harmful and make them feel like what they are getting is less than it could be, which shouldnt be the case.  Im enjoying the challenge but it is a challenge.  

My advice, for what its worthtalk to your professors.  If you need access to specific labs, can that be arranged either one on one or in a small group? Can they send you home with materials?  I teach in a nursing program and our students have to perform specific skills well.  They come in once a week in small groups to practice.  We also have the option to send home packets of supplies so they can practice there.  It can be done, it just make take some finagling to figure out.  

I started out my first class with my students telling them that yes, their experience will be different than any of us expected, but it wont be worse.  It has the opportunity to be even better than before.  Since you said your professors are nice, I bet they feel the same way.  Good luck to you!

As someone who deals with depressiondo you have access to healthcare through school or your parents?  I know this last six months has been hard on me mentally.

I was offered the opportunity to defer my enrollment for a year back in the summer and I'm starting to think that I should've just taken that opportunity and just hoped for the best come next fall.

I thought I was prepared for it, but after having taken a class, I'm not so sure anymore. The hollowness of it all and the knowledge of what's lost makes it so depressing.

As for you, many schools offer the ability to withdraw from classes within a period of time after the semester starts without a penalty in grade-point average. I'm not sure what your financial situation is, but if learning like this is as much of an issue for you as you're dictating here, it might still be possible to take a year off, maybe work during the year and only come back when you see fit to do so. Think to yourself whether the penalty of feeling like you're a year behind your class is worth the mental and educational anguish you're going through.

It sucks to be sure.  It's terrible.  But the alternative is just a few weeks of in-person waiting for the inevitable outbreak to happen and hoping you're not part of it.  Then everyone will be back online, minus some students and possibly teachers who get sick.  Possibly \*really\* sick.","3"

Im trying to do right by my students and teach them the material and build some sense of course community but its so hard over zoom. And sometimes I worry their sadness or disinterest is about me not 2020 despite knowing 2020 sucks and this sucks for everyone. 

I dont know if knowing both other students and instructors also feel the way you do is helpful. I think we all just need to make the best of it. 

What that looks like for you though, i dont know? Maybe that is a gap year?  You say you arent able to be out at home. Im glad you are paying attention to your safety but thats a large emotional stressor to bear. I didnt feel safe coming out till I lived in a state away from my parents. They eventually came around but its a process and I wouldnt advise people to do it impulsively. It gets worse before it gets better sometimes unfortunately. 

Its not too late to take a gap year or medical leave? If you did so, could you find a job that would allow you to afford a small studio apartment of your own? I know its not as exciting as campus life, but it sounds like having your own living space would at least allow you to feel you could express yourself how you wanted to. And I bet that alone could make this shitty year more tolerable.  If your friends are truly your friends, they will totally understand you graduating a year after them. And I suspect theyd want you to do what makes you feel best not what everyone is expecting you to do.

There is an up side for me, because I never liked in-person school, and before covid hit, I was begging to be home schooled to my parents. It seemed like a Godsend at first, but then it became a hell for me, mostly because I'm a band kid and playing is my life line. Not only that, it's starting to lose it's charm, it's not fun staying at home anymore, and this is coming from a recovered social hermit that wanted nothing more than to stay home and play Minecraft for hours. I, like everyone else, wants this over. It sucks for us all. 

Despite this, I always keep my moto, ""This too shall pass"" which sounds cliché, but it's true, and it will get better. Everything will be back to normal in no time, and life will be as good as it once was. Things will change, but the good will overshadow the bad, and even when the bad comes back, the cycle of good and bad interchanging will continue, keeping the balance in line.

Lately I also roll my eyes at the people who tell you to suck it up and stop complaining about not celebrating Christmas and New Year's. It's not selfish or childish to want to spend time with your family, maybe after not seeing them for a year.

Almost instantaneously it caused an absolute shitstorm on that network ""How dare you, you want people to get sick and die, you're valuing money over human lives, you're spreading COVID misinformation"" etc. Meanwhile all this guy said is that he's having trouble seeing how a packed Walmart is more safe than an almost completely empty restaurant. And he said absolutely nothing about masks, and even said that he is FOR mask wearing, but was labelled an anti-masker.","12"

Someone at the party made the 'mistake' of posting a picture of us hanging out inside maskeless on social media.

I can understand being serious about the virus, I am extremely serious about it too. But at the end of the day, we are HUMAN BEINGS.

It was a calculated risk we decided to take and it paid off - we talked about the party for weeks afterwords and we did not get sick.

Like to them, you're not only supposed to partake in the restrictions, but you are supposed to enjoy it and be happy about doing it. Any mention of ""I am partaking in the restrictions, but I hate being away from friends and family and want this to end already or hopefully soon"" gets met with ""you're priorities aren't straight"" or ""stop being selfish"" or ""it's only another year"" - which invalidates people missing their families, friends and normalcy. again i emphasize this is to people who are actually partaking in the lockdowns.

like myself, i am following the new restrictions from Washington state (the ones that came in back in November). But I hate living like this, it sucks. Not seeing friends, which was my one constant source of happiness to be honest along with soccer matches, is hard on me. I hate not seeing them. I get the restrictions and am abiding by them, but i'll be straight up in saying my mental health has suffered as a result and all my energy has drained. but i emphasize, i get and understand the restrictions. if i talk about this, there will be people who will downplay my issues and be upset that i am upset about living like this.

it speaks to people who have enjoyed staying home, people who i hate to label but aren't super into socializing. some of these people now have gotten a feeling of superiority or legitimacy from the lockdowns and restrictions, and relish seeing in their eyes extroverted people be forced to stay home. some of them truly want these restrictions and lockdown life to last forever or longer than what experts are saying.

My husband and i have been very very conservative about staying safe (we rarely go out/ leave the home). My husband is a homebody who already worked from home before the pandemic. His life hasnt changed much. Im a SAHM who had to shutter her small business (based in the party entertainment industry). Im often resentful of him for keeping me home so much. Being shamed by him for wanting to leave the home to just go to the grocery store once every month or so (we have been using instacart). I know hes just trying to keep us safe, but its getting very hard now. Its hard hearing about friends going grocery shopping and camping ...and that isnt safe enough for us. Combine that with the stay at home messaging and pro-mask messaging which is more open-ended than people understand. For example, you can go for a walk in your neighborhood or even a public park with a paved path , with barely anyone around and be safe not wearing a mask. But if i see people wearing them from afar, I feel shame. I feel anxiety that i need to put one on. I have no issue with masks at all, I am very pro-mask, but sometimes, when its safe, its nice to have a break. 

Thus, my main issue is the guilt. Guilt for leaving the house even to run an essential errand. And not wearing a mask, even when there is no requirement or need. There are more issues Im struggling with, but wont go into it, as its not relative to the OP main idea. 

I went to COSTCO for the first time in 9 months last week, and Trader Joes 30 min before that (next to each other in the shopping center), for the first time in 2 months. Wracked with anxiety the whole way there, inside Trader Joes, but then calmed down during COSTCO. And then the panic buying. Worried I wont have access again for another few months, buying what I know is cheaper or cannot be found via instacart. Then fearful of even telling people I went to the store, but so excited that I did, I want to share it, sigh. 

I was doing just fine for the first 4-5 mos. But once Fall hit, it got hard. And marital and other personal issues bubbled up. And this is coming from a very privileged woman. I had the time to develop hobbies and interests. I have one sweet little first grader and virtual schooling is going well. And despite losing my business, were doing just fine with my husbands secure, high income. We are more than comfortable. So its hard to admit its getting hard emotionally because I often feel I dont deserve to feel this way. My struggles arent the same. With all of that, Ive never once been inconsiderate of others struggles or priorities. I am a sensitive person and know friends and strangers are experiencing unimaginable stress and chaos. So it keeps me from reaching out to people or talking to a therapist.

This made me chuckle so hard :D, do you mind if I quote you in other threads? It's just too funny.

But yes, I get your frustration. Depression is slowly closing in on me. I don't really mind being isolated too much as I prefer being alone, but I can still see that others are just different and need company. You might be an extrovert who needs other people around to relax. I'm an introvert (although very outgoing when out and about) and I recharge best alone. My problem is that many people around me are starting to doubt the severity of the virus and acting rashly and imprudently. I'm very anxious for them and it has taken a toll on me mentally to feel so isolated on an emotional level. I think this situation is hard on all of us and may very well lead to some alienation from hitherto close relatives and friends :(.

I'm currently looking into getting help via hotlines or self-help groups. Maybe that could help you too? There's also lots of apps for neighbourly help in my country, you could help others shop or just take a walk with them if that's possible for you and within your safety measures.

Instead of blanket stating that everyone should stay home, government's should be urging people to see others in a Safe manner only.

I think a lot of people's risk tolerance is different, and it makes people uncomfortable tot see someone take risks they're not prepared to take. The stupid thing is, there's no one ""correct"" level of risk tolerance. I think the CDC put out ""Don't have Thanksgiving gatherings, but if you absolutely must, do it like this"" messaging. Abstinence is not the only message, but it does help people like me in really privileged situations. I live with good friends. I actually like WFH. I had some really bad feelings about skipping Christmas with my family, but once I made the decision, I made a bunch of workarounds to participate remotely in Christmas activities. Now I feel OK about it. I recognize not everyone is going to be OK in this situation, but everyone who does choose to completely abstain from family gatherings makes it safer for those who absolutely must travel.

The other problem is people will stretch the letter of the law to the absolute limit. Say the official position is, it's okay to have outdoor dining 6 feet apart. On the surface, it appears totally safe, because it is really really hard to transmit the virus with outdoor, maskless, socially distanced contact. I can still see people going ""Well, we have outdoor dining under a canopy, and that canopy happens to have sides, but it's outdoors so it's safe right?"" even though they are now effectively indoors. States like CA can feel frustrating because they are definitely outlawing some safe activities, but I think the goal is to stop people from making these unsafe stretches. I don't know if psychology supports that tactic.

I'm sorry your friends and family are shaming you. I'd like you to be aware that depression makes you misjudge others' opinion of you. If people ask what you're doing and don't know how to react when you say ""not much,"" that doesn't necessarily mean they're judging you. It's hard to continue the conversation from there. My coping strategy is doing lots of stuff. Yours might be watching TV, and there's nothing wrong with that. If it makes you feel better and doesn't hurt anyone, I call that a success.

It's okay to feel sad and to not get much done. I'm like 99% sure it's okay to see friends outdoors, either socially distant or mask-on. Missing things is totally understandable! I miss a lot of stuff too. I'm not going to have my friends over at all in these winter months, and that really sucks.","38"

No one is happy about it, no matter what you may perceive or what they may say about it.  The shame though is directed towards those we see on our social media timelines posing for maskless group selfies at Dave and Buster's while obese, diabetic, and mother of a newborn (see also; my sister in law).  The same ones who then go to in-person Thanksgiving with their 70 year old parents/in-laws (both in the same day even!), followed by a birthday party for their kid as he turns 1 the next day.  That's where my shame is directed, particularly when the only picture worth remembering that I have from this Thanksgiving is my 6 year old in snow gear putting her hand on the window of my in-laws' house with my 1 year old nephew that I haven't held since he was born on the other side putting his hand to hers.  That will be one she shows her grandkids.  And one that will bring me to tears every time I look at it for the rest of my life.

Fuck the productivity shamers.  This is hell on Earth.  Thankfully it's a year, maybe a year and change of hell, and it will end for most of us.  Sooner if more of us put ourselves through it for the sake of everyone around us.  Later if we give in to pandemic fatigue.  

I get the social struggle.  I fucking absolutely do.  This is horrible.  I'm lucky because I have an outdoor space where I live where I could hang out with friends at a distance safely during warm weather, so we had a few ""playdates"" with friends and my kids' friends where we all spread out 10+ feet apart and watched movies on a projector that we purchased just for this purpose.  Now that it's winter, we're all crawling the walls.  But I want to see my friends more than just the next time.  I want to see them next year, and the year after, and the year after that.  I want them to all come to my wife and I's 10th anniversary party.  I want them to come to my 50th birthday party since I couldn't have a 40th.  I'm not going to put their lives or mine in jeopardy because I don't want to wait a few more months.  

Long story short here is really, I feel you, I do.  But it's not for nothing, and giving up on it now is putting down the fire hose when the fire is nearly out.  We have to push through and finish this.  We started it properly, the government and most of the country seemed to have given up on it a few weeks later, but a lot of us are still trying to do what we can, and between that and the science finally catching up, we have a shot of ending it.  But only if we stick with it a little bit longer.","42"

Everytime someone tries to talk about why masks are important, social distancing, lockdowns, etc people on this sub don't like it. The reality is we're suffering because of those (ahem, politicians) who didn't listen to the recommendation of public health officials. If we'd just stayed in a strict lockdown for only a few months things would be much easier now. But I suppose this vague notion of being ""free"" to eat a cheeseburger inside a bar is far more important than saving lives. I'm mad that I have to continue to stay inside, but I think OP is angry at the wrong thing. Don't be angry at lockdowns--be angry at those who wouldn't listen to them and who refused to follow common sense. They ruined it for the rest of us. I hate staying inside all day every day more than anything but I also live in a state that never enforced lockdowns and we're seeing the fucking brunt of it.

Furthermore, the idea that economic prosperity (job loss, evictions, etc) are tied to lockdowns has been DEBUNKED. The economy will be shit, lockdown or not (we saw it in Sweden). 

I totally sympathize with OP and this has been the hardest year of my life--mentally, emotionally, etc. I've lost friends, my self esteem is tanked, and I had contemplated suicide at the beginning of all of this. But I'm going to do my best to let go of what I can't control (that's obviously easier said than done) and I hope the people in this sub who are angry at lockdowns (or in my case angry at those who wouldn't follow lockdowns) can come to that point too.","42_2"

I'm grateful that my two older kids understand this and are mad at mostly the right things.  At the government for not managing this properly, at the people who egregiously ignore the recommendations of scientists and doctors, and at the businesses and celebrities openly flouting any attempts by the government to enforce them.  I wish they'd peer pressure their friends who are flouting the proper behaviors, but you know what they say about wishes.  And really, if anyone had a wish to burn right now, I can think of far better ways to use it.

As for the economy, what I don't think people realize is how the half of the country who are doing the right things here wouldn't be going out anyway.  Open all the restaurants 100%, you couldn't pay me or my family to go eat at one right now.  Movie theaters?  Nope.  Concerts?  Not for a long time to come.  So long as COVID is a thing and my family isn't vaccinated, we're staying put, and I know we're part of a large chunk of this country in feeling that way.  That means those establishments wouldn't be paying their bills anyway, and when their staff and customers start getting sick, it would wind up as bad or worse than it is currently.  If we would just do the right thing for a bit, we could open up that much faster, and I'd be willing to bet that we'll come out of this on the other side eager as a nation to find ways back to something approaching the old normal.  

What's funnier to me is anytime a business gets crapped on for any other reason, their response is ""let the free market take care of it, they should have adapted.""  What's different this time?  I've watched some local businesses successfully adapt, and I've been supporting the hell out of them.  One high end restaurant in my town turned itself into a sort of grocer, selling their high end, locally sourced ingredients.  They've prepared dishes that can be just thrown in the oven to sell.  They brined turkeys for their customers and sold them fresh and brined for Thanksgiving (and damn was mine delicious!).  They're staying afloat by being creative.  I wish we'd support them as a society (read: my tax dollars going to them rather than some of the other places they're going that don't need them), but the same people crying about how this pandemic is killing small business are the same ones that turn their back on them and support tax cuts to the corporations that inevitably gobble them up in other times.  It's honestly sort of their version of virtue signalling at best, and mostly just a weapon to wield against the regulations that they find so inconvenient--right up until they or a family member wind up in the hospital, at which point most of them change their tune really quickly.

I get this is hard.  On the one hand, I can't imagine going through it alone.  On the other, going through it with three kids in remote school and following the guidelines while their friends and friends' families ignore the guidelines has been a hell of its own.  Whether they mean to or not, the kids put us through hell.  My wife is as stressed as I've ever seen her trying to stay on top of helping all of the children with their remote school as needed.  We're both stressed to have not had 5 seconds alone together since March.  But as my wife says to our family when they insist we break guidelines for holidays and birthdays, ""We will not become part of the problem.  We'll see you when this is over and are happy to Zoom with you or have the kids do so whenever you'd like.""  It's even harder to say when we're getting guilted by them and watching them on social media all gathering like nothing's any different, knowing they're grumbling about us behind our backs.

The virus is quite bad. I won't sugar coat it. It hurt, a lot. I can't say otherwise. During it I was cursing governments for not shutting their borders IMMEDIATELY. Its, no joke.

That said, every trauma has a ""half-life"", and most things in life last a while right?

This virus has a low half-life, as in, the bad part ends quickly. So unlike most things that stretch out, like financial difficulty etc that keeps going. The virus itself just keels over after a bit. Which is the ray of hope here.

My symptoms were the upper end of moderate, and that means I just barely escaped ventilators and needing oxygen. I however stayed calm, I didn't let the anxiety it pushed on me boil over. And that way I stayed conscious and able to handle it.

I believe this crisis will end after a few months. I don't believe it will kill as many as it is predicted to in the long run. It just HITS very hard initially, and is very very easily caught. This hard hitting nature of it is what creates the panic, because that part is very real. The part that comes after though is a calm (unusually quick to arrive, far faster than you would expect possible)

Avoid getting it! But look ahead to a better future, I think we will recover quickly from this. It hits hard, but fixes quick. That FIX, is the god send. And I believe that fix will come to our economy too. 

Don't get it though. It doesn't feel like a virus in how it hits you (unless you get a milder version) it feels more like a bad injury. BUT if you have support, if friends are with you, hope, focus, and kindness can help you through.

So stay calm if you get it. Hold yourself together. Be resolute and have a bit of faith.

One week later, the Food and Drug Administration approved a diagnostic test. The same day, CDC issued guidance for whether to close schools, resulting in some closures. The actual diagnostic test was shipped on May 1, 2009. On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization declared the novel H1N1 to be A pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the months that followed the first cases, CDC sent out multiple updates and guidelines and articulated who was at high risk for death. A vaccine was promised by late summer but not delivered until the autumn, after most of the cases had occurred. By end of the U.S. epidemic, about 60 million people had been infected and approximately 13,000 had died. As the Washington Post points out, in August 2009, the Presidents Council of Advisers on Science and Technology thought 30,000 to 90,000 people would die.  
&gt;  
&gt;On Jan. 1, 2010, the New York Times featured an article titled US Reaction to Swine Flu: Apt and Lucky, which served as something of a review of the government performance by a large handful of experts. Most gave the effort goodeven very goodmarks but said that it fell short of great, citing delays in the vaccine and managing public expectations as areas for improvement.  
&gt;  
&gt;That same month, a more buttoned-up group, the politically middle-of-the-road Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, gave something of a tsk-tsk judgment, declaring it not so great but not so bada routine number of hits and misses but solid middle-of-the-class responsiveness.  
&gt;  
&gt;&  
&gt;  
&gt;More recently, Justin Fox at Bloomberg Opinion wrote a thorough comparison of the Obama and Trump responses. He looked in particular at one popular criticism made by Trump supporters about the timing of Obamas declaration of a national emergency. The facts are that Obama declared a public health emergency a few weeks after the first cases in the U.S. This focused public attention and resources on the outbreak. In October, six months later, he declared a national emergency. Indeed, there are some subtle differences between the two federal responses, but for doctors and patients and human health, these bureaucratic distinctions are irrelevant.

But it hits SO HARD, I cannot say otherwise. It was like losing a limb to molten lava in how hard it hit me. So people who undersell it are quite wrong.

That said, the part of the hysteria that is wrong, is that it will last. After metaphorically losing that limb, it came back like magic after 6-8 gruelling hours of suffering with its loss. That... was unexpected.

My insight on this disease is that it has a SHORT halflife. Its only alive and a pandemic because it is SO easy to catch. But once it loses its grip, it goes like a leaf caught in the wind. Your body doesnt need to ""fight"" it until it beats it. It just needs to kind of ""kick it off you"". And then it loses its grip.

I believe society, will shrug it off after quarantine.

I believe that herd immunity is the WRONG WAY TO GO, because it HITS SO UNGODLY HARD (if you get more than moderate symptoms). The better way to go is to AVOID IT HARD, and neglect it any play. If we let lots of people get it to go for herd immunity, that is when it is going to hit you SO HARD. Avoid it, don't catch it, hide inside. Its like a hurricane.

Don't get hysterical, cuz it wont last I don't think. But the part of it being a bad time, THAT part is... quite real. Be resolute, be strong (not flippant), avoid getting it. And if you DO get it, by god, get a friend over to watch you!!! They can wear gear to not catch it. It is that SUPPORT that is so crucial in turning the tide. That support is as powerful as a vaccine in those moments I swear... I swear it is.

With coronavirus, it's like having the entire flu season in a month, plus no natural immunities and an unknown clinical path.  

We're shutting down cities because we need data: do people who recover develop immunity? For how long? What are the markers? Which comorbidities are most predictive? Which ones are irrelevant (or possibly protective)? What treatments work? Which ones exacerbate the problem? 

The trouble so far is that a lot of the data is noise at this point.  We don't quite have the signal yet.  Other than fever and dry cough (and possibly fatigue), people's symptoms are all over the place as of right now. Estimates of the infection rate, the r0 have ranged from just over 2 to 26--which is it? Is hydroxychloroquine a miracle cure or a psychosomatic false hope? 

What we do know is that our hospitals are getting slammed--not only with people who have the virus but people who think they might have it; I admit I was one of them, who panicked and went to urgent care. I have a sinus infection, probably due to an ear infection I had in February that didn't clear fully.  But I'll be honest; anxiety got to me yesterday. 

So this is the full picture, and it's not as bad as it might originally seem.  Death rates seem lower than first expected, children and those under 20 seem to have a much less serious course of disease (unlike flu). But there's a lot of confusion--different countries are testing *and* recording deaths differently. Different countries are using different drugs/treatments. There are different recommendations about masks. And the WHO and various national leaders, which should be at the center of this, have sometimes chosen to play political games rather than provide clear information (not calling out any country in particular here; many leaders were burying heads in the sand hoping this would be contained or blow over).

A temporary shut down--social distancing--will buy governments time to move out of ""crisis"" mode and into ""planning"" mode, which is more important--we can't simply make more PPE appear overnight, but we can gear up factories this week to start producing more masks next week.  We can retool production lines, reopen factory spaces to produce more drugs and equipment.  We can get testing to a point where it is easy to obtain.  Yes, this takes a lot of political will, and it's been the difficult part.  In the US, where I live it will have to involve not only the Federal government but the 50 state governments as well. These policies aren't made overnight either, but if the hospitals and health system make it through the first wave, we can gear up better for next time.

I've learned that it's really easy for people to talk shit about all of this when it doesn't directly affect them. And no matter how many real world experiences you put in front of them, they will continue to do so. I can only hope they don't have to experience what I have.","1_1"

(if they don't show any empathy regarding your loss, i would just quickly walk away from them because those types of people are scary and exhude bad energy. definitely don't argue about empathy with someone who doesn't have it to begin with).

you can also go to your local paper or social media if you want to write about your experience. if you do make some kind of art, you may find that medium to be an effective way to tell your story. 

but if it is too difficult to talk about, or you don't have the energy to deal with the person's reaction, i wouldn't worry too much about this right now. it's okay to heal first. you don't have to prove anything to anyone. you know what's right regarding the virus, and you are doing it. it's okay to do you.","1_1_1"

That said I think this is almost over, at least in America. The Delta variant gets around the vaccines so it will spread very rapidly and leave all the survivors with natural herd immunity. The vaccines do seem to provide a lot of protection against hospitalization and death, so hopefully the body count won't be too high.","14"

Ive tried literally everything to get rid of my depression and nothing works. My motivation is at an all time low. Therapy is helping, but only gradually and once I get out of therapy, it doesnt change this nightmare. 

I honestly wish there was a way to jail anyone who didnt get the vaccine. I know its harsh, but it is murder if you think about it. They could be tried in court with attempted murder and yeah, Id think this is realistic because they ARE killing others.

Ive always thought that political leaders arent man enough. 

A real man stands up for himself, his rights, and his beliefs. He puts his foot down when he needs to, will lead and make sure everything is done the way its supposed to, and wont take shit from other people, even if it means he winds up alone.

Truthfully, as a man, you cant worry about what other people think of your decisions. You just do what you feel is the right answer. 

FDR and gore are real men. FDR right now is likely turning in his grave and rightfully so.

I hope you get some rest and try your best to just curl up and watch some nice movies. I love comedies. Also calling a friend you trust is a good idea. Dont take shit from abusers and learn to move on quickly when you spot red flags.

What coping mechanisms have you tried for your OCD?

I started doing a little internet research, found that Amazon has been unionized internationally, and in the US, they're one of many companies whose employees have either successfully unionized, or are in the process. My parents are baby boomers, and in talking with my dad about it, he explained the benefits of unions, and it seems that's what Gen X and Millennials (me) have been missing: you pay an average of $85 per paycheck for contractual job security, living wages, solid and affordable healthcare benefits, and the enforcement of the federally mandated 30 to 60 minute unpaid lunch, and two 15 minute breaks per 8 hour shift. 


The demand for unions that had eliminated such conditions for Baby Boomers fell by the wayside as companies started offering healthcare benefits. But now that we've got full time Walmart employees on welfare and not receiving OT/holiday pay, Amazon warehouse employees and drivers allowed, and even encouraged, to wear diapers, and pretty much every employee I've ever had telling me I can get more done if I work through my unpaid breaks, unions are coming back!","1_3_1_1_1"

In the last 5-10 years, all areas of our lives (in the west at least) have shifted towards technology dependency at ridiculously fast rate, and COVID was the nail in the coffin when literally everything i our lives, such as work, shopping, love etc. becomes dependent on screens.  


It seems that cultures like working from home are probably here to stay as its easier and cheaper for employers for not provide an office space. They are not concerned buy the isolation and lack of healthy interaction that comes as a result of having no on-site workplace.

I really thought that 2020, being a new decade, could be a start of a process where we regulate to unstoppable prevalence of screens of social media in our lives, and then COVID hit and any opportunity for this became obsolete. 

Just looking at how well big tech such as Amazon, Tik Tok, and Zoom has done out of the carnage caused by there pandemic is frankly terrifying as reminds me that we live in a very unjust world where silicon valley tycoons profit immensely off by peoples life restrictions and misery.

Trust me, I would love to be proven wrong, but I see it as almost determined that younger generations such as gen Z and millennials will have lives that are significantly less satisfying and less rich in terms of both assets and quality of life.

I also think the pandemic escalated the isolating of culture that was made prevalent due to social media and the modern age of internet. The idea where people don't meet up as often and most of their catching up is over social media. That's nice and all but if people only socialize over social media after the pandemic is over, it's going to have consequences.

And aside from working from home more, think about shopping etc. Online shopping and home delivery and curbside pickup are probably going to continue after the pandemic. So people will only see one person who brings their order out or deliveries to their house instead of meeting people in stores, in town, etc. So even less socialization and more isolation. I don't think it's a good thing at all.

And also online schooling could be an issue with this as well. Although, thankfully I think most people can see this particular one is an issue at least and know that their kids need to interact with others their age.

I just remember in the early 2000s with the earlier internet age and even with video games this was an issue. People who kept to themselves all day in an isolated world had issues interacting with people and social skills or even life skills.

I fear this has been taken to a whole new level with the advent of social media. Back then it was just ""nerds"" who were like this, now it's a much larger part of society.

Maybe like you say, this time where people didn't feel safe socializing in person or meeting people will make society ""wake up"" and realize they need those interactions again, and less online and virtual stuff. I guess we'll see, but humans are forgetful creatures and once we are used to something it's harder go change back.","6_4"

My biggest piece of advice might be with school: there is absolutely nothing that says you can't take a semester off, and honestly I would recommend it if you can swing it. It would save you some money, it would save you from possibly getting bad grades if you're not feeling your best, and it means you can be more present for your family, who may really need you right now.

However, that lingering feeling of now you're part of the percentage that knows someone who died from the virus just sounds awful. To be that ""1%"" like its some sorta trophy or some sick joke. I couldn't stand it, I hated that statistic and I still do.  


Just take it easy, cry when you need to cry. Yell and shout when you need to. If for your mental health you need to just step away from social media, then do it. Don't read anything about covid, you'll drive yourself insane. Just take all the time you need, and I'm so so sorry this happened to you.   


If schooling can be put on hold for now, do that and start to save up. Go sign up for driving lessons, focus on getting your license. If you feel the need to talk to someone, don't hesitate. They're there to help you. Make out a road map of goals you can set for yourself to keep your mind focused.  


Remember he will always be there in your heart, and will be there waiting when you finally reunite!","6"

I cant imagine the flood of emotions youre experiencing. I think itd be completely normal to just want to sit in the dark and cry for a while. Feeling our feelings is a normal, healthy coping mechanism which allows them to move through us and resolve over time. Resisting feeling anything or numbing the pain with substances typically only prolongs the grieving process and further complicates things. So Im proud of you for feeling alllll of it and even for reaching out to strangers for support. I know it probably doesnt feel like it, but youre doing a great job of weathering an awful storm. 

If it helps at all, I was terrified of driving when I was 20. I lived in NYC, though so I could get around just fine with public transit. But that all changed as I got older and moved away from the city. I was 31 years old before I took my drivers test. I studied and practiced and finally went to the DMV. And you know what? I failed. I failed to come to a complete stop five feet before a stop sign and instead stopped *AT* the sign like most drivers. So I had to come back in a few weeks and try again. It was *humiliating* but necessary. And now I drive practically every day and its all second nature. I never forget to stop before a stop sign! Im sure your dad wished you knew that you were overthinking it and stressing yourself out. Im sure he thought youd do just fine once you got the hang of it.

Maybe set a goal of reading your local rules of the road handbook cover to cover and taking time to practice with your mom in a parking lot early on a weekend morning. Finding out that youre far more capable than you previously believed is so empowering and exciting! 

Im not religious but I do think that its possible that the energy of our loved ones may linger or visit from time to time. Im sure your dad would be so proud to see you pass that test and find some independence and self-confidence. Big hugs.","7"

My father is the same way and I fear for his life but if he's going to be so arrogant as to ignore his immediate families wishes then I hate to say it, but if he ends up dying, then I will consider it a selfish act he could have avoided.

In most people, COVID19 symptoms last for about a week and then clear up. In more serious cases, the virus doesn't clear but continues to replicate - as the body continues to (try to) fight it. This can last for weeks or even months until one side or the other wins, and/or the damage the body experiences from fighting the virus becomes too much, particularly if it weakens the body so much other infections take hold too.

We're gonna start being vaccinated in December 2020 if everything goes well, and since we are only 19 million people (in my country), life might be back to normal by summer. But this is provided the vaccine gets approved soon and our authorities actually take the vaccination campaign seriously.

Also, by late February much of the world will have built herd immunity against covid19. The real number of cases is \~10 times higher than the one reported, according to health experts.

There's not much more you can do to keep your cat from catching it, but at this point I'm certain veterinary knowledge of covid in animals has gone leaps and bounds from back then. Just keep an eye on your cats and if they start showing signs, schedule a visit with your vet to see what they can do for them.

Personally knowing how bad it can get - I'd take em to the vet just in case. If that's not a possibility I'd say just keep your eyes on them, give them fluids, etc. Keep in mind since I posted this vets know way more about covid in animals than they did when I posted this.","20_1"

I responded to your questions which seemed to imply that unless their area is overwhelmed they will get a ventilator which makes seeing the OP's brother and children is not as risky.  I also addressed how they could see them before a vaccine because your question asked basically if the OP expected them to never see each other until a vaccine.  You did not ask what people expected would happen in a year so I did not presume that is what you were looking for. 

However, how and what will change depends on a lot including how states are opened, the availability of PPE, and if Americans will  act responsibly. We will have more solid info on if Remdesivir  or any of the drug cocktails that are being tested work to treat/shorten the severity and duration of symptoms.  More vaccines will have begun human trials and others will be close to the end of clinical trials.  The realist in me does not think any of these things will be done correctly and with enough distribution to save the economy or people.  The extrapolation of those beliefs is not suited to this sub so I will not continue but let's just say I have a very dark view for our future.","11_1_1_1"

&gt;You do not have to be good.  
You do not have to walk on your knees  
For a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.  
You only have to let the soft animal of your body
love what it loves.  

&gt;Tell me about your despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.  
Meanwhile the world goes on.  
Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain  
are moving across the landscapes,  
over the prairies and the deep trees,  
the mountains and the rivers.  
Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,
are heading home again.  

&gt;Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,  
the world offers itself to your imagination,  
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting --  
over and over announcing your place  
in the family of things.","2"

Eventually things will settle, and you realize that you have become a different person, but survived. That's when you've come to terms with things having changed.

The only way to *go* through it, is to *grow* through it.

The only thing I can recommend is meditation and lots of it. Also try to journal 20 minutes a day.

I've been basically alone my entire life before the pandemic (due to undiagnosed autism), and even more alone during the pandemic with zero support network.

What has helped me has been this formula:

**"" 20 minutes of exercise a day**  
*\[it seriously doesn't matter what kind, all you want to do is get your heart beat up into the triple digits. it works very well as stress release\]*

**"" 20 minutes of meditation a day**  
*\[Basically just close your eyes and stay like that until your mind clears. it might take hours at first, but there's quiet at the end of all those thoughts that are rambling about your head. The most important thing is to try not to judge yourself for whatever you are thinking. It's harder than you think, but it's completely possible to let go of\]*

**"" 20 minutes of stretching a day**  
*\[basically yoga, but anywhere I have a sore spot in my body, I lean into that and stay there until the pain stops. Sort of like forcing a muscle to relax by not letting it go\]*

**"" 20 minutes of journaling a day**  
*\[write down your thoughts and keep writing. the idea is to let your thoughts out unfiltered. it works the same as the meditation, but in a different way because you are engaging your muscles and logging stuff. it helps with processing your feelings\]*

You want a new job and you'd like to see your family. Those are both perfectly reasonable and doable. Schedule time each day or each week to look for jobs and work on your resume and CV. Keep doing that and you will find a new job. Rather than planning a surprise trip (never really advisable imo) plan with your family.

Usually, companies only provide WFH to tenured agents or after training has started. Also, on-site work has this very big advantage: immediate floor support.

That's when she started her crappola and she took it to the max quickly.

We have been no contact for about a year now. There is no path moving forward with a relationship with them that doesn't involve being completely submissive to them.

They have been sending nasty voicemails or texts occasionally for a year and we never replied. Then they showed up unannounced on our doorstep almost a month ago with Christmas presents for the kids they have been holding hostage for two years...

They yelled and screamed even though I said we weren't having this conversation in front of the kids. Were super pissed that we wouldn't let them inside. My MIL even told my DH he needed to choose(between me or them). She said it 3 different times and my kids heard that. The first thing my daughter said after it was over was ""why did grandma say daddy had to choose?"".  My heart broke knowing my daughter heard that.

For some parents, boundaries work. For my in laws, it does not. Everyone is different.

I was very go with the flow, bend over backwards for mine for probably 13 out of 15 years. It gave them the impression that I was ok with walking all over me. But then we started putting our foot down with boundaries and not rewarding their crappy behavior and that wasn't something they liked. A month ago with them showing up announced and yelling was their attempt to get us to submit again and it didn't go well for them. My MIL told me I had a serpent tongue.

My parents in law actually don't care for my kids at all, but they have 9 other grandchildren and a great grandchild. So they spend their time with them. That's fine, it's my in-laws loss. My kids are ridiculously adored by my side of the family.

 A lot of others who deal with crappy in laws tell their kids that the parents are in time out. I told my daughter that this is what standing up to a bully looks like. She is school age, so I felt the lesson fit well.

The stress of the jobs demands that worse with fewer employees to comply with social isolation. The reality of how critically short we are on PPEs. The disappointment when we have forgotten the situation of PPEs. The mental stress of knowing that running out is inevitable at this rate... But to be truthful and honest of it all? For me personally, I'm happy where I am. My dream is to help others, be able to take care of them in times of need.

A third of my company was laid off. Needless to say, the waiting to find out who was unlucky and the crazy hours have been terrible - and I'm one of the lucky ones. Of course, raises aren't a thing this year and I'm guessing won't be for a few more years, either. 

Quitting is always an option. It's not a moral failing, and you don't have any obligations to a company to stay if the situation isn't good for you. 

I do wonder, however, if there aren't some things you can try first. Have you talked to your boss about it? Are they the kind of person who you can have that sort of conversation with? If not, do you think it would be easier if you got a few coworkers to bring it up at the same time? It's harder to ignore multiple people, and I can't imagine you're the only one feeling that way. I know when I brought it up to my boss, she helped push back on deadlines that weren't necessary and made sure I took a few extra days off to help make up for all the extra hours. If your work isn't life or death, there may be some options to lighten the load, at least for a bit, so you can get your feet back under you. 

If that doesn't help, what do you think would happen if you just slowed down? Obviously there are situations where that could get you fired, and I don't necessarily recommend that (although you could probably get unemployment then at least!) but, especially if you're generally a good employee, even a couple of months of sub par performance probably wouldn't have dire consequences. Maybe a lower raise, maybe a worse review score, but less drastic than quitting and still maybe enough to help get you back to where you need to be. 

But in the end, if you quit, that's okay too. I suggest the other steps first for a few reasons: one, because it sucks to pull from your emergency fund, even though that's the reason for it, and two, because I know personally the only thing worse for me than the insane hours I was doing would be not working (too much time to think), although that doesn't mean you'd be the same way. Whatever you decide, I wish you luck!","5"

I'm going to schedule and talk soon with mangement and at least hear them out, but in the end I just don't see any way our team's situation can be helped. If I don't complete my daily workload, I can potentially cost the company thousands of dollars in a single day. So that extra pressure is really fun /s. The thing is our team is so swamped with work, no one can really cover my workload so if I were to even take a single day off, I would be so backed up with emails and work. Just thinking about that gives me anxiety. 

Sorry about your situation. Yup the crazy hours are well...crazy. The fact that companies aren't really doing anything to boost employee moral really shows their true colors. 

Although I do know I don't have a moral obligation to this company, I also don't want to screw over my coworkers as they are good people. That's mainly the thing that has guilt tripped me from quitting.","5_1"

My work was making me miserable - not even that I was overworked, but once the social aspects of my job were stripped away by WFH it quickly became apparent that my line of work doesn't suit me at all. Tasks I was thoroughly capable of would cause me disproportionate stress. Every day I'd wake up feeling sick with dread and I'd finish every day feeling unproductive and miserable. I ended up on sick leave after I took a week of holiday and spent the days before my return crying on and off and barely able to talk to anyone. I realised I'd been experiencing a huge amount of ongoing guilt and stress from my chosen career for years, which I was better able to ignore when I could go to the pub with my lovely coworkers at the end of a hard day. 

I also had (have) some money stashed away, and was very conflicted about giving up my job in a time when many people have lost theirs. But having the option in itself is a privilege. Why continue to be so unhappy for.. What? To avoid the judgement of a select few others? 2020 has proven that nothing is guaranteed for anyone. Life is too precious to punish yourself without good reason, when you have a way out. 

I consulted many friends and family on what I should do and they were unanimously supportive of my decision to quit. So I did, I'm taking the time to complete my master's degree, and I've now lined up some training that will help me move into another industry. Life is good again. As you say, nobody will ask too many questions about why you stopped working in the middle of a pandemic. The best thing you can do is have a plan, and figure out how you can have something to show for your time off. It sounds like you have plenty of ideas already.

My insomnia is gone and I actually feel like I'm living life rather than going through the motions. I am spending a lot less money because I don't need that ""treat"" on the weekend or whatever to make me feel better from a week of hellish work.

After taking a month vacation (i.e., just filling my days with me time like walking at the park, reading, hobbies), I'm now doing an online degree in a tech field that I've always wanted to get in to, so my days are pretty structured.

I don't know if you're American and have that issue, but I was going to quit until I remembered health insurance and it's super important to have that during a pandemic.

Instead, I've been staying at a job giving me immense anxiety. There was one confirmed positive case at the office, who I had close contact with. Thankfully I tested negative. Right now two more employees are quarantining because one had contact with a positive family member, and the two have lunch together in close quarters every day. I was at one of their desks on Tuesday, but I was wearing my mask and keeping my distance so I'm not too worried. Plus, no results back from either of them just yet.

And I just keep thinking about how little I'd have to worry about if we were just working from home. So, I guess in a way, my problem is kinda opposite of yours lol. Still lots of mental health issues, but for opposite reasons.

imo, if you know you have funds to cover yourself for like 2 years and you don't have to worry about health insurance, then quit. I once quit a job thinking I'd get another one right when I needed it, it took me 8 months of searching to find a job. That's why I say make sure you have funds for at least 2 years. You might not get another job as quickly as you expect.

EDIT: One last thing I wanted to make a point on. Playing devil's advocate, taking a year off ""because global pandemic"" would probably look bad to an employer here in the US, but again not sure where you're from. It shows some uncertainty on their part that you will stick around if, let's say the vaccine fails and we have to go back to worrying about covid, or a bad flu year. I know my employer would throw your resume right in the garbage after the interview if you said that.

In your shoes I'd tell a bit of a white lie: ""My employer was not allowing me to work from home and I live with at-risk family members, so I decided to protect them by quitting and finding a work at home job. Job market was understandably pretty tight though."" yada yada.

I've been working on leaving this job, just working on building up some new skills. I've kinda been ""pigeon holed"" into a certain skillset that is hurting me in finding something new as most jobs in the field want a broader skillset. I've had a lot of anxiety preventing me from seeking out new skills in my free time, but I think covid has made me so numb to anxiety that I'm just doing it now lol.

Good luck! I hope everything works out for you and you find a better employer when covid is over.","14_1_1"

Im quitting at the end of the year. While Im looking for other jobs, the one Im in now is impossible. Maybe if I wasnt working from home, it would be manageable. There are so many reasons I  just cant do it anymore. My job is numbers-driven and I cant meet my quotas because no one wants the product Im selling b/c COVID. I had terrible onboarding and I still dont have the support to get basic questions answered. People are angry and defensive and humility is seen as weakness. Maybe I could deal with this if I could go into the office, casually chat with the coworkers I like. But my home is my office now, so I cant separate the two. There are no breaks. 

If I get another job, Ill probably still be stressed and angry and frustrated a lot, but Im not putting that much energy in my job search anyway. Im a part time grad student, so if I cant find anything that is less maddening in the next few months, Ill just focus on school. Also, I could spend more time with my nephew that just turned 1 in July, maybe hell babysit more. 

I only have enough saved for a few months, so itll be loans for me. My me and my boyfriend of 5 years are thinking about getting married just so I can go on his insurance when I quit. My school doesnt offer insurance for students in my program, so I may go for insurance on the marketplace. 

Im so glad you posted this because Ive felt guilty. I know people are struggling to find work, or to find insurance, or maybe they have a job that isnt keeping them safe. But I also feel guilty because I cant keep doing this. I have gone on two different anti anxiety medications since COVID and its helped, but not enough. At least by quitting I open a door for someone who is looking for a job like mine. Maybe they can do better than I did.","18"

After all, you can work as much as you want because youre always in the office and it is easy to end up working way more than you should if you dont establish clear boundaries. 

Also, the lack of socialization is a challenge that did get to me initially. 

Something I find useful is talking a short walk at the end of the day and playing music that I never listen to during work hours. Somehow, it helps me relax and feel the work day is over. 

Something else that has made a big difference for me, is tracking the amount of time I spend on specific tasks, as well as how much time I spend on certain tools and websites. 

To track the amount of time I spend on specific tasks I use Toggl, and for automatically tracking the tools and sites I visit, I use RescueTime to get a weekly report of how much time I spend on things like news sites, or tools like Skype.

Let that sink in for a second.

Your risk is quite low. You may still get it, but your symptoms will be much more mild most likely. If you even get symptoms at all.

Our decisions are made on a risk/reward system. If a reward is too risky, we don't go for it. The reward of hanging out with friends or going to a concert wasn't worth it as an unvaccinated person, especially during the height of the pandemic.

It's why most people don't wear masks during flu season. The risk is low enough that we don't bother with it.

But now? The risk as a vaccinated person against COVID is much lower, that most of us believe it's worth it to go back to normal. And the data seems to back this up.

You basically do smell physical therapy and therapy. You smell essential oils in a quiet space and try to remember that smell and good associations with it and mediate. Increasing omega 3s I believe has also showed some promise, but I'm not a doctor so consult if you can.

As for delta, if you are fully vaccinated, you do not have to go back to lockdown for the foreseeable future. I get that you are scared and likely wont listen, but your risk of getting covid again as a breakthrough is low. the risk of having ANY symptoms if you did is even lower, let alone bad symptoms which is almost non existent, and the risk of hospitalization and/or death is even lower than that. 

NOW THINK ABOUT THIS.... there is small risk to everything. You are so focused on the minuscule risk of getting a severe breakthrough infection, that you are forgetting the risks to other things like unnecessary isolation and stress, the long term effects will be WAY worse on you. Your mental health is clearly deteriorating, long term effects of stress and anxiety are not good. It can wreak havoc on your body. You absolutely should go out, travel, see friends, etc.

Out of 157 million vaccinated people only 733 were reported to have died in the entire country. Basically staying in your home you have a greater risk than from covid. Wayyyy more people die simply from falling in their homes. All this to say, life has risk. Each risk needs to be assessed. Covid breakthroughs should not be your primary concern. Focus on rebuilding your mental and physical health and find a new therapist who can help you with your catastrophic thinking, anxiety, and in a way, agoraphobia.

One thing to note is we still as a global society want to mitigate how the virus changes/mutates, the more cases the more likely it will become drug resistant, so you could still wear a mask in crowded spaces, but even that wont help as much since there are still so many unvaccinated people spreading it, but in terms of personal risk, try to think about what else you are risking by isolating instead of just focusing all your anxieties on covid.

All the best! Good luck!

i still wear a mask in crowded spaces. we actually went to an outdoor theme park months ago after vaccination (basically six flags but not) on an off-peak day and there was almost NO ONE there. we kept away from the tables and groups of people, but despite things being wiped down and social distancing and double masks , i was still uncomfortable. enjoyed my time, but always still had that lingering feeling of ""what if.."" or being afraid every time i heard a cough or sneeze somewhere. sometimes i have to remind myself that allergies and colds still exist.","6_1"

I have a lot of allergies too and have smell sensitivities that trigger migraines so I get that. But there must be some that dont. And even just strong smelling things might work, like stick your nose in a bag of coffee. Just make sure you are alone in a quiet dark room, id recommend meditating first snd then trying to make memory associations with the object.

Keep track in your phone or on paper of all her symptoms with dates and times, as it will help you establish a clear timeline especially if you get less sleep or more stressed.

The second someone gets symptoms while a close contact, they are automatically a person under investigation (PUI) and must self-isolate for 10 days.

The second he self-isolates, all his close-household contacts are required to quarantine for 14 days from the date of last exposure - for most normal people with kids, that means they quarantine for his 10 day isolation + 14 day quarantine (24 days).

The second any of the close-household contacts show any symptoms, their quarantine is converted to an isolation, and they are presumed positive (PUI). They would need to isolate for 10 days minimum, with at least 24 hours fever free without the use of fever-reducing medications. 

If your son came into my primary care clinic with ANY symptoms as a known-close household contact on quarantine, I would immediately convert the quarantine to a 10 day isolation + send for testing. I would make them finish their isolation no matter what the PCR test showed.

The whole point of the lockdown was to delay the spread so that not everyone gets sick at once, which would overwhelm the healthcare system; it was never to prevent anyone from getting it. If the hospitals have room for people who require hospitalization, which gives people the best chance they're going to have of recovery, it doesn't matter if there are 10 cases or 10 million; people still have the best chance they're going to have of recovering. 

Where I am, cases are still increasing (though the amount by which cases are increasing is decreasing), but hospitalizations are quickly decreasing, which means that it's the right decision to start opening up, even though people are scared of the ever-increasing case count. 

That being said, if you feel like you or your family is at a high risk or your tolerance of perceived risk is such that you don't feel comfortable resuming normal life, there's nothing wrong with continuing to self-isolate on your own accord and continue to voluntarily take all the safety precautions. Though, if I were you, I would start taking baby steps back towards regular life because the case count will never be 0 and there will always be some small risk, so if you feel anxious to resume normal life, maybe consider talking to a mental health service provider or taking small, gradual steps back towards normal life.","1"

It doesn't have to be in person, it could be a phone call or face timing them. Or even calling your friends or family. Talking to as many people about it helps. Walks and exercising helps, when I had bad panic attacks it would help me to go on walks. Grounding exercises are amazing. Try focusing on your senses and surroundings. To your left, what does that texture feel like? Is it cold? How is it different compared to what's to your right? Is there any fabric items around you? Is it soft? Smooth? I'm still new at it but I highly suggest looking up grounding exercises. It's helped me alot.

You mentioned you worry about your parents in the medical profession, I recommend having a conversation with them too. Talk to them about your concerns and worries. Communicating with your parents might help ease your anxiety a little bit. I have family and friends who work in hospitals and other service providers. Knowing that their work is prioritizing their safety and keeping a clean and healthy working environment and they themselves are doing the safe keeps my mind at ease.

Keep yourself safe, continue to take preventative measures, wear a mask when you're in public, wash your hands everything you and your family have been doing.

I wish my country had taken it as seriously as yours did in the beginning. We were too busy fighting amongst each other on why it was fake and not worth our efforts. It wasn't until things got out of control where we started to care a little bit. There are  a good chunk of people today that don't care. 

I'm lucky my city took it seriously, but it is stressful to see everyone else outside my city go stir crazy. The fact that you care about your safety and health, have followed through with the protective measures to keep yourself safe, and continue to care puts you ahead of many who didn't even try. You're doing a great job.

Stay calm, keep doing what you're doing to keep yourself and your family safe. Talk to your family, friends, go on walks, grounding exercises! and see if you can find a therapist. 

There is a lot if dark and uncertainty right now but the good news is, it won't be like this forever. Keep positive and find the small things that make life happy and beautiful. Focus on those, don't dwell in the darkness too much, you deserve to be happy.

Social Distancing will not be permanent, but like the others have said, I think it will be around for a while, at the very least until we find a vaccine. 

Personally, I love it, as I become incredibly anxious when someone invades my personal space. I think the upside is that people will be more respectful of each other before jumping in for unwanted hugs and physical affection, and I'm all for it.

That being said, physical contact is an intrinsic part of human nature, and we all crave it to some extent, so yes, social distancing will become a thing of the past sooner or later, but like the others have said, I think the way we communicate and show affection will change, but solely based on our own personal preferences.

When I look at my own family, I can see the effects of the Great Depression ripple out through the generations  my grandparents lived through it, passed on behaviour related to money and frugality to my dad, and my dad passed them on to me. My mom's family lived through persecution and genocide, and there's plenty of residual weirdness over that, even a few generations later. Covid itself isn't the Great Depression or World War II, but it's traumatizing the world and it's reasonable to expect it to having lasting effects on the people who live through it.

Soon we'll be figuring out lower-risk social activities and how to engage in them. It wouldn't surprise me if people started developing lasting taboos over casual indoor socialization and physical contact, perhaps with those activities becoming a sign of trust and intimacy in a way they aren't now. It also wouldn't surprise me if people develop taboos over large gatherings, like it becoming normal for weddings to be restricted to only close family in physical attendance with live streaming for everyone else. And I expect many companies will downsize their physical office space as telework becomes widely accepted, but I think having a physical office will remain important for most companies.

As someone that has severe anxiety I've been trying to remind myself that it's my anxiety playing up and making my negative thoughts much worse.  


I honestly do not believe that social distancing will last forever. Worst case scenario is until 2022 but we have to remember that it's the *worst case scenario,* we truly don't know when this is going to end and it's not out of the realm of possibility that it could end earlier. Obviously I don't know this for certain, everything is up in the air because we're still trying to figure out this virus but as we tend to gravitate towards negative bias (which is done for our survival, we need to figure out what is a threat and what isn't!) we tend to assume that the worst is inevitable. But it can go the other way too, maybe not now but eventually. Considering that people are already getting sick of social distancing after only 2 months I seriously doubt that people will put up with this for the rest of their lives.  


I assume you're referring to comments that Boris Johnson made today? I think when politicians and scientists are saying that ""this will last years"" they're simply trying to get people used to the idea that this a marathon, not a sprint. I remember back in March witnessing in horror at the idea that we may have to do this until mid-2021, then there was that report that the end date would be 2022, and suddenly mid-2021 seemed doable.  


So now that Johnson mentioned that social distancing might be here to stay? Well, 2022 doesn't seem so bad anymore ;) I think most people would rather believe that this will last a while and be pleasantly surprised when it doesn't, than believe that this will be over soon and be bitterly disappointed when it keeps going.   


No one can predict the future, we can only make educated guesses as to what's going to happen. But considering that this is hardly the first pandemic (and sadly won't be the last, but hopefully we won't have another one for a long time!) we've gotten through, I feel confident that, as absolutely tough and horrible as it is to endure, we will get through this one and social distancing will be a thing of the past. Maybe not now, maybe not soon, but eventually, this will pass.","9"

That said. When this is all over, and there's a vaccine, and we can go do regular things safely again, I'm gonna hug everyone I've ever known. I'm going to lick a crowded bus all over town, visit everyone I've ever met, and give them a huge hug. 

I think a lot of us are really missing people, and I could see a lot of people being even more open and warm with others after this.

Remember, the jackasses making decisions are not actually connected to our world. Scientists and politicians live in realities theyve dreamed up inside their nice houses, with loads of money, and a low-risk that any catastrophe will actually affect them in any way. 

Its super easy for them to say new normal, no hugs, dont visit grandma ever again, but they either are not aware or wont publicly admit that society wont allow that to happen. 

Look all around the word. People are bailing on social distancing already because its unsustainable. Humans are meant to physically contact each other. Not only that, but humanity will die out if we avoid physical interaction forever, romance would become something frowned upon, and people would be reluctant to partake in the activity that creates more humans.

Youre out of your mind if you think people are going to stop fucking for more than a few months.

Think about it this way, if we had no measures in place to stop the spread of the virus, there would be a far greater risk and far more cases in general.

While my 90 year old aunt didn't die of COVID, she was in a nursing home when she died.  And due to COVID restrictions, we couldn't visit her before her final day and I think that she gave up because she thought she was abandoned.  She had shades of dementia which made it hard for her caretakers to explain to her in a meaningful way that we weren't abandoning her, we just couldn't visit.

Media that posts titles like this without realizing the potential harm and stress it may cause to the public. Hopefully this makes a bit more sense and lackluster to submit a title like that. Be careful reading absurd titles. Try your best to avoid sensationalized titles and just focus on your day to day. Better yet, challenge yourself to look at the data yourself.

I know how it feels. Its rough. Just know better days are on the way. I have OCD and the media just made me even more anxious. I stayed away from reading the news (please unsub from r/coronavirus) and instead focused on reading scientific papers at r/COVID19 where things are much more optimistic. 

Focus on what you can control and make the best out of the situation you're in.

Does the infected bar-tender know who they caught it from - was the transmission likely to have happened at the bar, or did they get infected elsewhere and bring it to the bar with them? How likely are they to have infected anyone other than the co-worker who has also been sent home (maybe no-one if they were the only two staff on that day)? What precautions do they take to protect customers from them and them from customers? The balance of these may not make you taking on the task dangerous.

A second issue is whether it's fair to be asking you to take on an additional part-time job on top of already working full-time, which is entirely up to you.

It may be that your mother is struggling to find staff who take seriously precautions she wants in place and feels that you will help her in this regard.

Working in a restaurant where someone tested positive (particularly after it's been deep-cleaned) is only risky if the route of transmission still exists - this is the key question to ask. If it hasn't, or what it was isn't known, the problem is still there but if it is known it may have been mitigated and/or removed. Still doesn't mean you have to work two jobs if you don't have to.","2"

Different generations react differently to certain situations and sometimes there can be a push through it and soldier on mentality. She might be scared of losing the restaurant or maybe being understaffed is a fear for her that triggers that irrational reaction. Youve done the right thing saying no. Everyone has the right to set boundaries, even with family, and sounds like yours are very reasonable. If living there is contingent on helping at the family restaurant when you already have a full time job (or even if you didnt have another job but choose not to work there) then Id say its time to look at moving out if you can. Make it about you and that you feel you need to claim some independence back and reassure her youre still there for her. Dont be too hard on your mum if you think its denial out of fear driving her decisions and behaviour. Do your best to help (within your boundaries) but you need to protect yourself and your own mental and physical health. Hopefully she comes around and sees your point of view on this when shes had a little time to process.

If it helps you feel better about your decision, in Australia if someone tests positive and even visits a restaurant, the restaurant is immediately shut down for a mandatory deep clean, all employees go into 14 day mandatory quarantine and contact tracing requests anyone who was there at the same time also isolate for 14 days. Not to sound too heavy because I know rules are different elsewhere, but in Australia your mum would be considered to be breaking the law by staying open after a positive case.

To your mom, Texas seemed scary because she had no personal control of your situation there. If you live with her and work at her restaurant, then she thinks that she has more control and can keep you safer. It's the same way that people feel safer driving, even though flying in a plane is far, far safer, statistically. Your mom literally has Covid inside her restaurant; this is the exact time to be blowing everything out of proportion, asking questions, and taking the necessary precautions like shutting down until all the staff are tested. Not only does this put you at risk, it also puts her and the customers at risk too. Unfortunately, because our brains are emotional, your mom thinks she can easily beat the odds because she is in control.

In reality, you were probably safer in Texas despite the statewide spike because of your responsible actions. By living with your mom, you are actually more at risk because of her actions, especially while she works in an environment that is constantly exposed to the public. Even if her restaurant was taking precautions, she can no longer claim it is the safest in the county if she refuses to take the necessary steps when an employee is infected. If she did take the necessary precautions, then I wonder why she became so defensive when questioned. She should be taking your worries into consideration as much as you take hers into consideration.

Unfortunately, I doubt that you'll be able to convince your mom about any of this. I would give her some time to cool off before trying to mend things. Like the others said, boundaries are important, especially when it comes to family. You already compromised to her fears by moving in with her. You have a full time job already. You have your own responsibilities to deal with too. You don't owe her anything for getting to stay at her place. You were already living on your own. You moved in to help calm her nerves. She owes you that. If she absolutely cannot communicate properly about this, then it might be time to find somewhere else to live.","9"

There is some evidence that strong air conditioning can blow it from one table to another in a crowded restaurant but not that it can enter the circulating air flow. So that's one thing less to worry about. 

Your body temperature will not reach fever temperature from walking. You feel hot because you've exercised but this is not the same as fever, and you may not be using the thermometer properly - they are very hard to use. Are you being checked by staff who have been trained to use them properly?

Your company is doing something. That's better than nothing. The production line environments where it has spread widely have largely been hit before any precautions were taken. 

Masks stop people who are infected from infecting others - even an imperfect, thin mask will stop most particles and there is some evidence that such conditions may spread a smaller dose that results in much milder symptoms. Assuming the coworker next to you is infected, which they probably aren't. You also say that some of your coworkers have been infected (presumably not from the work environment) and this hasn't resulted in it spreading through your workplace. That's good. 

You might also want to talk to your boss and coworkers to discuss your concerns of living with higher-risk family members and whether you could be offered any additional protection. If there's not room for every member of staff to maintain 2m distance, is there room for some to do so? Could you be on the end of a line, with someone who you feel takes good precautions next to you? Could you move position during the day, so that you're not always next to the same person (as constant exposure is likely to be more of an issue than a single cough)?

Are you able to keep a bottle of sanitiser with you to clean your hands regularly? If not, it's reasonable to ask if adjustments can be made to allow this. 

So, while I appreciate how difficult the situation is for you, there are things you can do to protect yourself and it does sound as if your employers are doing a reasonable amount to protect you all and overall, the situation does not sound particularly high-risk.","3"

I realize my body temp wont reach fever temp from walking. My personal body temp tends to run high anyway, so likely my temp was probably around 98 or so.

There are also reusable N95 cloth masks, which can be gently wiped with disinfecting wipes - because they are reusable, they're not really suitable for medical settings where the masks should be changed more frequently, so you don't have to feel guilty about using them (if that is a moral issue for you).

Once you get a certain number vaccinated it become harder for the virus to spread and there will be no need for any of these measures. The whole point of the vaccine is reduce death and hospitalizations. Once that is reduced dramatically there is no need for any current measures.

You will get to go to theme park again. it is simply not viable for places whose economies depend on these places to keep restrictions longer than needed.

You will go to concerts again. Many places are already talking about having them this summer.  Music is a whole industry and entire economies and livelihoods depend on it.

Yes your baby will get have a good life and carefree childhood. There is absolutely no reason to believe the current masked and distanced world is all they will know.

Whenever one of them would try the kicking and shouting I would do one of two things, 1.) get down on the floor and do the exact same thing they did where it would end by them laughing and eventually...dissipating their anger or 2.) Get down on my knees to their level, hold them firmly by the shoulders and talk to them as if they were grownups. Reason with them, find out what is bothering them and offer a couple of solutions-(all of course should lead to what you want them to do). Sneaky, eh? 

Example:  ""Would you like to pick up your toys now or in fifteen minutes?"" 

""How will you take your toys away, a basket or one by one?""

You are giving them power to choose at a time where we all have limited power.

Be as honest as you can with everyone without losing your cool. Ask them ""How can we all work together to make this a safe and happy time?, What kind of things would help?""

How do you think your teen would respond if you were to sit him down and basically say, look, I'm not gonna dress this up, this is one of the most crazy and stressful times that *anyone* has lived through, and we're gonna need you to really step it up and basically kick in as a grown-up in terms of responsibilities for a little while. 

I find, when I'm talking to teens, that if I give them *no* bullshit - like, ""Hey, I can't even *tell* you that this is gonna be okay, because I'm not sure that it is. Nobody is sure. But I can honestly tell you that we need you to pull more weight, because no one was prepared for this."" Most of the time they respond pretty well.

I would work on how you and your husband and cope with emotions and also on teaching the kids how to calm down when they get upset and some coping mechanisms for doing so
4) make a chore chart and everyone has to choose at least one chore to do each day. If your son has a big kid tantrum about it , he loses a privilege for the day.

There is no absolute guarantee your parents will become seriously ill.

Your parents could contract it and only have a mild illness thanks to vaccines and boosters. Evidence shows that Omicron is milder than Delta. And the boosters may also offer some layer of protection too from contracting it. My 59 year old mother has severe athsma and was a COVID close contact three times (my father had it twice, my sister once). She hasn't caught it despite sharing a bed with my father and living in a small one bathroom bungalow with my father and sister ! I am still very concerned for her and my grandparents who are 88 and 93 this year. But they all have their triple shot of vaccine and I hope that will keep them safe if they do contract it. 

These are worrying times and I sympathise with you greatly. I thought we were all going to get seriously ill or my older relatives would die when my father contracted COVID last year before vaccines but it wasn't as bad as I feared. Those in my family who did get it had mild symptoms, barring my aunt who unfortunately suffers from long COVID back in March 2020. However, she feels she has noted an improvement in her health since the summer 2021.

I know the risk is still high and not every family got off so easily but don't worsen your mental health by imagining the worst case scenario (I know that is easier said than done). There is a lot of fear mongering out there, some by the media just for the clicks and some by medical authorities / public officials but that is just to highlight the potential severity of the disease to people who wouldn't or aren't taking it seriously. Thankfully, you and your family are aware of the seriousness of it and will do the right things to keep yourselves safe.

Keep doing what you're doing and continue to take precautions but don't fall into a doom spiral that this is it for your parents.","3_1_1"

My parents are in their mid-50's and are unhealthy, have a whole slew of medical issues that increase their risk of death. My father has been full time on oxygen for over a year and has to have it to survive. So the entire pandemic, them getting it has been my absolute worst fear. They're both double vaxxed (not boosted).

And it happened in early December. My mom got it at work (she'd stupidly gotten bullied by coworkers into feeling embarrassed about masking!), brought it home to my dad, and thus began a couple of weeks worth of agonizing and crying and panicking worrying about them. I am happy to report that they both made it out okay, and my father (who we worried about the most) had next to no real symptoms outside of a ""tickle in his chest"". While this is 100% anecdotal, I hope that it can maybe comfort you a little in knowing that it is possible to survive it even when the odds are scary. The vaccines definitely help and I fear what might've happened without them.

I hope that your parents stay safe and healthy, and so do you. Take care of your mental health as best as you can.","7"

She is 74 and has a heart condition, is classed as clinically extremely vulnerable and was shielding last year (were in the UK). I live with her and was able to work from home from March 2020 to May 2021, I ended up having a nervous breakdown about being called back to the office at that time even though things were a lot better here then. Fast forward to now and despite the government advising people to wfh home again my company said no, everyone is staying on site. 

My mum only had her booster mid December due to being housebound, so I requested to wfh temporarily for 2 weeks whilst it kicked in and she had full protection. Long story short HR reacted like Id asked to nuke the place and refused, however my manager thankfully overrode them and allowed me to.

Today was my first day back in the office and Ive been terrified. During my absence work decided hmmmm maybe ~16 people in a windowless office with no ventilation isnt a great idea... and split us into a 2 team rota working one week in the office and one at home (better than nothing but I still just dont see why we cant just wfh if we would be and feel safer, which was the policy a year ago). All well and good except instead of 8 people in we had 11 as some people are having issues with laptops and need IT to sort (not done as half of that department is off with covid because someone was forced to come in when their partner was sick with it...). To top it off the guy directly behind me has an awful cough and although he says hes been lateral flow testing I just dont trust them as I know too many people who have tested negative on them with symptoms only to be positive, likewise another colleague had covid last week and is back in, yet another has a kid suspected to have it... I just feel so scared as I have no control anymore and despite fighting with work will still feel like I could have done more should anything happen to my mum (to add I also have an underlying condition and dont think Ill have an easy time with it either) but it just feels inevitable now.

This dismissal of peoples feelings and experiences is driving me bonkers. Its also incredibly ableist of them.

So its less likely they will get severely ill yes its more contagious but even with delta there was always a risk of getting it even if you take lots of precautions its better for it to be less dangerous if they do get it. 

There are also the new antivirals I am not sure how avaliable they are but maybe you could ask your Dr as those are shown to cut the risk by alot all you can do is try and stay safe and I really do hope that if your parents do catch its a very mild case .","28"

I have lived a similar situation to many, here and elsewhere, during this pandemic - elderly parents, one of whom had enough significant medical issues (CHF, AF, COPD, Type II diabetes) to make us all believe that the next thing to come along would kill him. My parents were fully vaccinated and lived the soft lockdown. We avoided visits together because of what we believed to be the risk of me traveling and acquiring \_something\_ that would infect them. We did that through most of the pandemic. Last month my dad's other issues caught up to him and killed him, not COVID. 

I carry enormous regret over not finding a different way to manage the risk (and our perception of it). He's gone, just gone, but hey, we kept him from getting COVID. Rather hollow accomplishment.

And do we \_know\_ he'd never had COVID? No. We just suspect it because he did all the things he was supposed to do.

I'm not going to try to downplay the risk in your situation. And I can't tell you that what you're doing is wrong. I can say through the perfect lens of hindsight that I personally would have tried to figure out a different path for us to be together in my dad's latter days.","29"

I know the N95 medical masks are going to medical personnel, but there are reusable N95 masks out there.  Can you and some of your coworkers pool resources and invest in these?  I've been checking Amazon daily, and monitoring availability of these masks, and there seem to be more of them available at reasonable prices.

There are also people volunteering their time and making cloth masks.  Unless these home-made masks have filters, they are not as effective as the N95 masks, but they do afford some protection.  And, they are reusable.  You might reach out to one of the many organizations making these masks, and ask for some.

As to hand sanitizers, we've been using Isopropyl Alcohol 99%.  I've included a link that tells you how to make your own hand sanitizer.

These may not be ideal solutions, but they are better than nothing.

Yeah I had a hard time working in restaurants now that COVID is happening. Kind of similiar because I worked in close proximity with people. The stress got to me, and I quit when someone at work got COVID, and the restaurant still refused to wear masks unless customers came in. I'm lucky to have a savings and a family that understands

That and as your boyfriend can tell you, the restaurant industry has gotten way harder with COVID.

Wear a mask if you don't already all the time at work. Can you eat outside in the back or in your car?

I worked next to the woman who got COVID at my work, and I was the only one wearing a mask. I did not get sick or pass it to my family. It doesn't give 100% protection, but its better than nothing

I am trying to find other work. If the stress is getting to you, I would suggest a grocery store or a costco nearby, since most of them(at least in California) are very strict about mask wearing, sanitizing, and safety. Costco and Trader Joe's are good places to work at rn because of how seriously they are taking COVID.","2"

That sounds like something that'd give you less stress and still pay. You'd have to weigh if the paycut is worth it. 

But having health insurance with the company sounds great, and that your company is taking it somewhat seriously by testing and isolating contact people. Not many companies are taking it seriously tbh, so that's good that you're able to work there.

I would weigh out what 1-1 care places offer you in terms of pay and benefits before leaving. Especially health coverage.

I'm sorry OP these are sucky times. I can't stand office jobs either so I can relate. Maybe look into running or some sort of exercise like biking to help take the edge off your anxiety.

From the little I understand about your field, no one will fault you for taking a step back.

Look at it this way: if you had a friend that was a violent alcoholic, and if you invited them to stay over they would inevitably drink and put your family at risk, your partner would be justified asking you not to invite them over because it's her home (and yours) and your home is primarily a place where you are safe. Inviting guests is nice, but there are other ways to accommodate visitors (e.g. hotels).

Edit: regarding pressure, unless your motivation is *specifically* to make her life harder so she will get the vaccine then you are not putting pressure on her. There are natural consequences to our decisions, and sometimes that will result in natural pressure, but you are not responsible for protecting unvaccinated people from accountability. They can choose not to get the vaccine, and they can live with not being invited to places where their unvaccinated status puts people at risk. I can choose to stop bathing, and that's totally my choice, but if people don't want me around because of the stench that's their prerogative.","2"

I am fully vaccinated and pro vaccine. I don't often let ANYone in my home these days. I'd rather wait until Delta is no longer the most prevalent variant. When workers need to come in, they're masked rather than me asking vaccine status. 

What I don't understand is why so many vaxxed people think they are safer around a single vaccinated person than they are around a single unvaccinated person. 

If you are unmasked indoors and ANYONE there has Covid, you can catch it from either status individual. It's airborne so it lingers. I don't see many businesses taking that part seriously enough, at least in the US.

Some vaccinated people can catch and spread Covid.   
Not all **un**vaccinated people are infected.  
**Un**vaccinated people who are infected aren't carrying a different form of Covid than vaccinated people.   
It's the same virus, it's just less likely to affect YOU if YOU'RE vaccinated.  
What's not known is whether a vaccinated person with Covid can spread it when they don't have symptoms.

I understand that people think that **un**vaccinated people might be more risky in general. To that I counter: there are vaccinated people who feel pretty invincible right now, who are acting somewhat ""risky"" in light of the Delta variant.

That's just my opinion. I try to base it on science and reason and what I'm personally comfortable with based on my health status, both physical and mental.

But you have some very valid questions and I'd like to help you find answers if I can:

&gt;I have nothing against the vaccine and I don't doubt its efficacy, but I know a couple who took the shot and still got COVID after a couple weeks, with worse syntoms than when I had it (and one of them had a few bad days after taking the vaccine, which seems to be somewhat normal).

Unfortunately, no vaccine is 100% effective. But the COVID vaccines can definitely help *prevent* you from getting and spreading the virus that causes coronavirus.  
Vaccinated people have around 50% to 60% reduced risk of infection overall. Studies have shown that unvaccinated people are 7 times more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than vaccinated people and 49 times more likely to be hospitalised than vaccinated people. The more people get the vaccine, the more protected we are overall as a community. (Here's a good [source](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/227713/coronavirus-infections-three-times-lower-double/) you can read on some of what I've outlined here).

&gt;Why should I take the vaccine if I was already infected and the vaccine immunization is not permanent and might wane after about 6-months. I just don't see why I should take it, since it seems I'm already somewhat immunized and seems more like a risk at this time...

Apologies if I'm wrong or jumping to conclusions here but I'm not sure where you're getting the information that vaccination isn't permanent? To be honest, [the jury seems to be out on that one](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/will-covid-19-vaccines-give-lifelong-immunity-to-the-disease-what-we-know) \- but we know for now that they definitely keep us safe for at least a year at a time.  
Before COVID, I was still a pro-vaxxer in that I got a flu shot every year. Yes, it only kept me immunised for roughly a year until the *next* flu season but it certainly gave me amazing peace of mind for those few months.

&gt;Also something that I don't understand, if I get the vaccine I can still spread the virus unknowingly, right? Isn't it preferable for me to get a sore throat, know that I'm infected and stay at home instead of just spreading the virus without knowing?

See how you used the word ""unknowingly""? What if you get asymptomatic coronavirus or you spread it *before* symptoms start presenting themselves? One of those people you could potentially spread it to could be more likely than you to become severely ill or end up in intensive care.  
I'm not saying this to scare you but because if you don't get COVID, you can't spread COVID to someone else. Emily R. Smith, an epidemiologist and assistant professor at The George Washington University's Milkin Institute School of Public Health, has said that getting vaccinated benefits both you and the people in your community ([source](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/08/16/fact-check-covid-19-vaccines-work-protect-others/8106810002/)).","12_1"

In fact to do otherwise seems to me to be utterly foolish.  I don't know where you are, but assuming the US.  Our healthcare system here is failing.  All over the country people are not able to access important medical care because of the number of COVID patients clogging the system.  I have a friend who just completed chemo for breast cancer but cannot get her mastectomy done because of what's happening.  The Children's Hospital in my area just shut several locations and suspended a lot of services, and others around the country are doing the same as they can't keep up with the number of patients, largely exacerbated because of COVID.  

People are dying outside of hospitals while trying to find one to treat their treatable and typically non-fatal condition.  Unvaccinated people are the cause of this.  4 out of every 5 people in a hospital with COVID right now are unvaccinated.  This crisis would not be happening if they had gotten the shot.","13"

"https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/pq29kd/is_it_unreasonable_for_me_to_ask_that_only/","[deleted]","2021-09-18",1631977851,2,2,0,0,"Yes! Totally comfortable. I think right now we're lacking a lot of honesty and nuance in these discussions so I'm happy to provide my thoughts and experiences through this if it helps anyone.

Two members of my family, including myself were last vaxxed in late May with Pfizer. Two other members of my family were vaxxed last in April with J&amp;J. The other person who got Delta was a child who is too young to be vaccinated. Everyone wears masks in public. We've tried to consider where we got it from (without blame) and really don't have a good answer for it. There really wasn't a place that we were that we really ever felt uncomfortable. Typically when we eat out, we eat outside and we don't mind eating inside a restaurant provided there is enough space between tables, but we much prefer outside. We also cook a lot at home so, it could have been while grocery shopping. Part of the reason I don't think what happened bothers me is... well, I knew it was an inevitability. To me, it was always inevitable that Covid would become endemic and that at some point in our lives, we would get it, and probably multiple times. I did hope to delay when I got it for the first time, but now that I got it, I tell myself... hey, maybe it's good that I got it now and maybe my immune system learned something from the experience. I know I learned something from it.

Edit: Unvaxxed child had mild fevers for 4 consecutive nights on Day 1 of my symptoms. She has been perfect ever since. Thankfully. I love her to the moon and back. We gave her liquid children's tylenol, childern's vitamins, and a lot of orange and mango juice through all of it. She was always in a good mood during it and her biggest symptom was just tiredness for that week.

My experience: I did not have the typical symptom progression that they talk about, and mine was also the reverse of everyone in my family. I actually felt almost nothing but the most mild symptoms for the first 10 full days. I was the one telling everyone else to think positively (the two elders that contracted it always said that with their comorbidities, they would be goners if they ever contracted it). I sort of told everyone that they'd be surprised how relatively easy the thing would be to beat. I stressed eating healthy, fluids, a positive mindset, vitamins, and getting sun outside for their Vitamin D (not in public). They all had their worst symptoms first (both elders received monoclonal antibodies out of an abundance of caution during their worst day) and everyone in my family were seemingly out of the woods by Day 9-10, even the elders. 

The person that said... ahh, this won't be such a big deal? I got completely walloped on Day 11 and 12. Today is day 13 and I'm feeling much better but Day 11 and 12 were just brutal, but by brutal, it felt like the worst cold I'd had in a long time. The worst part of my experience was that I didn't really have resources during this time because if you google Covid-related resources, all of the search results have been curated down to a simplistic guide to how to get the vaccine. I get it. I'm pro-vax. But when you're already vaccinated, awake at 2:00 am feeling like total bleep and you're curious about symptom progression, remedies, and real people discussing their own experiences (which have been censored from the internet), it's a little lonely. 

I don't think anyone who hasn't experienced that will truly understand what I mean. For fun, I went through 122 Google Search page results just to see if I could find anything valuable for myself. Honestly, not really. I realize that companies like Google, Facebook, etc want to limit the people who might be causing trouble for some through misinformation (understandable), but in doing so, they've truly limited the amount of helpful information as well.

I can tell you what I think I found valuable in my own experience. Around Day 6-7, I began feeling a light pressure in my lungs. The thing that absolutely works when you feel it is to do deep breathing exercises. Calm, deep breaths. I would do those in the shower with steam and just randomly throughout the day. It felt good and I just imagined that even if I wasn't sick, that doing these breathing exercises must be good for us when we're healthy so I'm currently planning to begin meditation when this is over (I imagine in a few days).

On Day 10, I basically considered my experience to be concluding and I became less vigilant about staying hydrated and nourished. I don't know if it was completely the reason for Day 11 and Day 12's awfulness, but it couldn't have helped. So, if you do get it, don't take a day off from doing all the right things. That's actually something I've determined is a good thing for the future: I plan to change my diet after this experience. If eating healthier made me feel better when I was sick, I should do that too when I'm healthy.

Getting outside helped a lot. On private property, not in public, I felt that it helped my outlook tremendously. Getting sun. Watching the trees. Having fun. I would recommend that when and where possible, it's a good idea to get out of the dark, gloomy house and enjoy a bit of nature without exhausting yourself.

Another thing that made me feel worse was looking at my cell phone. Again, I don't mean to read too much into everything, but it gave me a headache and generally made me feel worse. I tend to think it does that to people when we're healthy too. I plan to cut down tremendously on my amount of phone time for my own mental and physical well-being.

I tried to hit on as much as I could but if you have any specific questions, let me know. In short, I wouldn't allow this thing to make us alienate ourselves from others. I think Covid reminded us of our own mortality and it scared us all. And sometimes when we're scared, we lash out at others. People who vax up and wear masks have been taught to hate those that don't and those that don't do either have been taught to hate those that do. And in the end, we're probably being divided for a reason. I read a book during this that I think will have a positive effect on me for the rest of my life: A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle. Chapter 3 and beyond regarding the ego is very valuable.","15_1_1"

Reach out to those who support you and let them know you're having a hard time. Get your friends to check up on you so you don't feel like you're alone... they don't have to physically be there to be present, just use those strategies of connecting with them you've already developed over the past few months. And if you didn't work on those strategies, now is the time. Perhaps you can find a new hobby or skill to work on to keep you busy. Try learning a new language, getting into physical shape, taking up arts and crafts, anything that slightly intrigues you. It will be hard to do things because you're probably a little depressed.

Ill tell you what I did though, and maybe that will help, maybe not. Getting a therapist was a huge help. Giving myself time to grieve - not just the relationship, but the fact that you cant go and meet new people or hug friends the normal way to get over a breakup. Adopting a cat from a local shelter made me feel less alone. Relying heavily on friends - calling them, playing games online. Knowing that I just wasnt going to be as good as my job as usual for a while and accepting that (Im a teacher and we went to online learning so it was already difficult). And finally using online platforms like meetup to meet new people, for friendship, not romance. That was the biggest help. Theres so many communities going online right now, so what are you interested in? What have you been wanting to try? Nows your chance.

Are you able to get some sunshine? Do you have a porch or something? Being inside all the time is bad for you--open the windows, even if it's a bit chilly. It isn't a cure, but it does help keep your spirits up. Also: Showers, wearing nice clothes, proper healthy meals instead of snacks.

Can you talk to your neighbors face to face? If you're far enough away, it's safe to do that. Just a chat over the back fence, maybe... nothing major but should help you keep from being so lonely.

What about voice chat on your computer? Many people find it more personal than typing. Join a group on Discord and talk about stuff.

Keep trying with the hobbies and entertainment, by the way. It does help; keeping your mind busy is great. Online lessons are good. Make yourself a cup of tea or something, make it a proper occasion; you're learning new things and that's precious.","6"

I agree with the changes you named here being positive, but like I said in the past, I can not wait, am desperate, like literally all my friends, to get back to pre-covid life in terms of my anime events, free hugs, talking excitedly with people, making new friends, going on photos with everyone, etc, being allowed to be a normal human being again.

This whole new normal living hell is making me feel like an animal in a cage. Basically everyone I know feels the same way.

And yes, there is a lot of suffering going on. I have to repress the deepest fiber of my being as an extrovert with a lot of life energy and also very happy go lucky to keep up with this living hell of social distancing. Being unable to go to a fun event, meet new people, talk excitedly with them, hug them, be spontaneous and just do what I want and have goofy carefree fun is literal torture for me and always will be. And basically everyone I know.

Everything I life for, and find fun in life is forbidden right now. Being a normal social human being is not allowed.

Anything over zoom is shit in comparison. The event we had with social distancing rules present was only one thing: depresssing. Sad. Everyone only said how much they hoped that the restrictions would be lifted soon.

So, just to clarify here: I surely hope that when you say ""long-term readjustments"" you mean more working from home.

But still place to just go to a festival, danceclub, or anime convenion or whatever as we knew them again, and sing, dance, hug, and meet each other again liek we always did. It is what makes life worth living.

So basically the same as the poster above me , the term ""new normal"" gives me a panic attack for exactly the same reasons as them. Please be more specific when using it, (almost) no-one wants to live in a world were normal, fun, spontaneous social contact is not possible anymore. No-one wants to live with social distancing, no hugs, no talking loudly, no big events, no spontanity, no nightclubs, no dancing forever. We want our lives back from these restrictions. And that is what the ""new normal"" has come to represent: a dystopian hell of a future in which that never happens.","1_1_1_1_1_2"

It's a term that now embedded in popular vernacular and isn't going to go away. Ditto 'stay safe' which some people also find triggering. They're just words - not offensive, racist, misogynist or damaging words, many of which have also been reclaimed and celebrated by the communities they were used against, such as 'queer' - and if you don't want the 'new normal' to represent a dystopian hell, which it really doesn't, start using it rather than being afraid of it.

It may well take a while for festivals, conventions, nightclubs etc to come back. It may also mean that when the first ones do, they're not over crowded, fixated on cramming too many people in at the expense of making money and actually end up being much better experiences. It may be that they encourage grouping attendees into 'bubble' groups that actually makes it easier people who come alone and are shy to talk to others and links them up with people who share specific interests. It may mean that you can get from the bar to your friends easily without spilling beer over everyone you have to squeeze through on the way, and don't wake up to find you the entrance to your tent blocked by someone else's. One person's hell can be another's Utopia.

One thing the pandemic is doing is making everyone pause and think ""was this really the best way to do things? Is this something l want to go back to?"" Where the answer is yes, that will come back. But where it's no, there's the opportunity to chance. What emerges from that will be a new normal that will emerge gradually, not over night. It will depend on vaccine timelines, individual risk profiles, how people react and behave... a lot of variables. It may mean a virtual Anime convention this year, a socially distanced one next year and one that's more like the 'old days' the following year. So work with that and determine how best to do the things you enjoy best in the environment you have - meeting up with old friends, meeting new ones, doing cosplay, learning about new shows/comics you didn't know about before... take the initiative and make it as fun as you can. It might also help to take your mind of what you can't have - while also helping to ensure a global pandemic stays under control.","1_1_1_1_1_2_1"

Or to use your own example: I quarantee you those words were not reclaimed just by using them at random without explaining, or the other person knowing, you mean something different from 99% of people. In order to reclaim a word, by definition, you have to explain what \*you\* mean with it. When it was a slur, if a random person just without context used the word queer, they'd probably get a punch in the face. So if you want to reclaim a word, at first, it helps to explain that as you use it ;)

&amp;#x200B;

99% of the time its used to mean that ""like the old days"" never comes back. Like I said, no-one (almost) wants that. I haven't met a single soul at that entire event, and there were around 1250 people, who didnt absolutely hate the social distancing and want the convention to be more like the old days as you say. And more here means ""exactly"". There is an incredibly strong urge amongst 99.99999+% of the visitors to just be allowed to do what they want again ASAP. I also asked convention organisers I know - and they all said ""we will get back to normal as soon as possible, bring those vaccines!""

I really, really, REALLY don't want ""bubbles"" - I get what you mean, but trust me, the vast majority wants to run around freely, have fun, hug, take photos, and make NEW friends.

Look, anything that emerges naturally as you say not because of restrictions but because most enjoy it more AFTER restrictions are lifted, is probably a positive change. But I want the restrictions lifted. I don't want someone to tell me anymore that when I see a fellow yaoi freak, I have to stay 6 feet from them, not go on a photo, not talk to loud, etc. I can not stand it anymore. No spontanity, no enthousiasm, no emotions. Or well, I can stand it just fine, if I know it won't be forever. I just want to be my bubbly, extroverted, happy go lucky self again, and be allowed to hug whoever the hell wants one. I want to be allowed to scream excitedly about favorite ships and series again and just goof around. Having to constantly go against my deepest nature is extremely tiring and depressing. And no, it will never get better. Off course I do what you say and make the best of it - but the only reason I can do that, I have the mental energy to do that, is because I know that in the larger scheme of things, the pandemic will end, the restrictions will end, and eventually, we will all be able to go to our events again the way everyone prefers them: as they have always been. (Hopefully with a livestream to be followed in case its one thats one the other side of the planet like the BL con whose panels I could finally follow for once last month LOL).

&amp;#x200B;

As you say ""if the answer is yes, it will come back"". I guarantee you, like I am willing to bet my arm on it, that the overwhelming majority of attendees and organisers will say ""Y E S!"" in this case, and as such, indeed they will come back. Its that very KNOWLEDGE that I take the energy from to make the best from it right now, and that is keeping me happy and without mental issues for the past months. It's the one rock keeping me sane.

&amp;#x200B;

And the thing is, for that one rock to exist, I need to know these godforsaken restrictions will end one day. Off course some things like working from home will stay more etc. And as you say, that is good. But this fandom is literally my life. 100%. And the fact that every soul I know can not wait to get back to 2019 in those specific terms, gives me the confidence, as you say, it will happen once restrictions are over. And THAT is why I can panick with the term new normal in its ""restrictions forever"" meaning - then that can't happen, and thats a scenario I dont even want to contemplate for I immediately feel existential dread, togethew with almost everyone I know.

&amp;#x200B;

And like I said, I REALLY (and almost no-one I know) don't  want to have to go in a bubble. I already have friends - the whole point is to make new ones. Talk to different people! A bubble would feel just as much like a prison as the current rules. And you don't require people not to be free in who they talk to to make it easier for shy people right!?! I can not imagine - and feel sheer terror at - that emerging as something people would want to stay post-restrictions. BLERGH.

&amp;#x200B;

Off course you are right one person's hell can be another's utopia - thats why everyone should be free to do what THEY like best! EG I ALWAYS ask poeple if they want a hug even if they have a free hug sign. Or want to go on a photo. Etc. If someone doesnt want it, fine! Friends! But I want it to be OUR choice again. Etc.

&amp;#x200B;

But I don't want to be assigned a group of people that are the only ones I can have contact with. I wanna hang out and enjoy with the entire ""family"".

&amp;#x200B;

Now don't get me wrong - off course right now all those are good ideas to be able to organise SOMETHING at least - but everyone I talk to who is organiusing these events and implements them stresses 5000 tims they hate to have to do it and can't wait to dump them in the trash ASAP.

&amp;#x200B;

I expect (since april!) that to take untill 2022. So my expectation is literally the same as yours in that regard. And that is not a problem. I just NEED, in order to keep going and not jump out of the window, that dot on the horizon that this hell will end and they will be back like the old days even if it takes 2 years. Off course, if things can be done better, that should, and will evolve naturally, it always has, and I don't even care if someone calls it the new normal. But I want the restrictions gone, so that I can get my old life back - the part that did work really well and was just about perfect. Like me and my friend's favorite cons. And not have to worry about being alloted bubbles,  having to stay apart if both of us want a hug, not talk too loud, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Because I don't care if its someone's utopia - for me and the vast, vast majority its a living hell. I want to have my life back. And I have always respected if people don 't want a hug or wan to stay in a bubble of friends - it doesnt need to be forced upon me for that ;)","1_1_1_1_1_2_1_1"

This is the absolute crux of the issue and why everyone has to work together to find solutions that work for everyone. Things can get 'back to normal' when  it's safe to do so - at the moment it's not and when it will be, and to what degree of safety, is still an inexact science. It's not a living hell for the vast, vast majority - it's a spectrum on which some people are much happier with home working, limited social contact and quieter gatherings, others hate it. But at the moment it's necessary to prevent unnecessary deaths and having patience with that for a year or two shouldn't be too much to ask. In the meantime, make the best of what is possible rather than focusing on what isn't. Are there fan networks that can simulate some kind of social gathering - gaming evenings, quizzes, movie nights on Discord.... you might find there are high-risk fans who will be hugely appreciative of this and become your best friends once the 'proper' events come back.","1_1_1_1_1_2_1_1_2"

In fact I literally said that in the exact same words almost.

I literally said: "" I expect (since april!) that to take untill 2022. So my expectation is literally the same as yours in that regard. And that is not a problem. I just NEED, in order to keep going and not jump out of the window, that dot on the horizon that this hell will end and they will be back like the old days even if it takes 2 years ""

&amp;#x200B;

So I have no problem waiting. 0. Zilch.

&amp;#x200B;

All I am saying, is that the knowledge that we \*will\* eventually get back to normal, even if takes into 2022, is what is keeping me from despair. And what is giving me the energy to stay positive and focusing on what is possible right now and still enjoying that while waiting patiently instead of just collapsing into total dread.

&amp;#x200B;

As long as I \*KNOW\* that we will get back to normal, I honestly dont care if it takes 6 months or 2 years. I just need to know it will happen, and as long as I know that, I completely agree with you and are doing \*exactly\* what you are suggesting for the same reason ;)

&amp;#x200B;

Although I have to say ""what degree of safety"" in your comment wou scare me again. I don't want say only large events being a thing of the past - those are the ones I miss. I don't really care when the bars come back, I don't go there. I just need to know that in the future, it will be possible to go to an event again like they were and like the vast majority of people prefer them (it might be a ""spectrum"", but 70% or so of people are extroverted, and even the introverts I know want our cons back as they were. In my circle, and I think amongst young people in general, it's much closer to 100%, and we all know it. The majority might like more work from home, sure, but almost everyone wants the restrictions gone so we can get the parts back of our lives that we DID enjoy and now miss. The only difference is how burning the desire is, and what exactly we are missing.).

&amp;#x200B;

I just need to know that eventually, an event like I linked above will be possible again exactly like that (by which I mean no restrictions and with everyone being free to hug, photo, whatever they wanna do) and as long as I don't lose my unshakeable faith in that, I am fine waiting.

&amp;#x200B;

But I asked around 20 different experts over the past week that same question for an article I am writing indepedently from my own interests, using that same youtube video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoOsATngkJk&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoOsATngkJk&amp;t=1s) ) as an example of when true normal life could resume, and they \*unamously\*, indepedently of each other, said ""towards the end of next year/2022"", ""don't worry about it"", ""that will be back"". Most also said they miss normal life themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

The only difference really was whether or not they thought you might also have a quick test before entering. But literally every single one of them was certain by 2022 that would be back, with the hugs and everything. It was a handy go-to to use as a representation of ""back to normal"" since it includes everything: singing, hugging, talking loudly, etc. :D

&amp;#x200B;

So I am not concerned. And in the meantime, I will do exactly as you say, because again, we agree 100% on that. I just \*NEED\* that reassurance for myself to be able to do that, but luckily I have it, and Fauci's  recent comments, the experts I asked, the fact that its the number 1 priority of every government, the fact by far most people want it and we live in democracies, and the much better then even the biggest optimist expected vaccine news all give me the rock-solid 100% certain faith I need to stay happy while I wait. I just can not doubt it without experiencing true terror, but I havent had to doubt it for the past months, and that was even before the vaccine news.","1_1_1_1_1_2_1_1_2_1"

In prison, there are very few things to do. Many prisoners aren't even allowed books or TV. Punitive solitary confinement usually means no entertainment. Communication with other human beings is also cut off; at best there are letters. They have little or no Internet access. It's not the simple aloneness that makes solitary confinement torture; if it were, the introverts among the prisoners would request it. It's the lack of anything to do, anyone to interact with, any mental stimulation. That's why they come out of solitary with mental problems.

&gt; too much PTSD because this could even happen

It's always happened and will always happen. We're gonna handle it better next time.

Infectious disease is a necessary part of life - it's often detrimental but also we wouldn't be here at all without it. Literally, [humans exist because a virus inserted itself into the DNA of our ancestors and laid the foundations for mammalian birth](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/endogenous-retroviruses/).

Epidemics have been a part of humanity since our first ancestors stopped wandering from place to place and decided to create a village. And we've been passing diseases (plague, tb, flu) back and forth with animals for thousands of years. We've survived and thrived every single time. In fact, we're doing better than ever. You're alive at a time when those diseases, for the first time in history, are all going to be eradicated or completely controlled within the lifetime of most people on the planet.

What is a terrible, difficult time for many people is also the threshold of a better, longer, safer life for more people than ever before. The stuff that's on the horizon is incredible. As someone who works at the intersection of science and technology, I can promise you the next ten years are going to be the most interesting time to be alive there has ever been. This virus is a tiny blip in comparison.

&gt; I want to give up

I know it seems like a lot and seems like you won't be OK. But you will. That PTSD (if it develops) is not unsolvable - you'll beat it with professional support. In two years you'll look back and be so grateful that you didn't give up.

So do not give up. Be kind to yourself. Ask for help if you need it - from the people in your life or from strangers on the internet (you're welcome to DM).

You definitely will be OK, and it won't even be that far in the future. You seem very certain that you won't, but I'm very certain that you will and I'm here to convince you!","8_1"

Humanity has gone through MANY pandemics, most of them before tv, books and phones existed for the wider public. I mean, issac newton invented calculus by candle light during a pandemic. and those people all came out fine on the other side. 

will there be some people who suffer long term affects? Sure. As with ANYTHING tragic, it's a frightening time to live in some respects. 

But this is NOT solitary confinement, and this is not true isolation, even for extroverts who crave social activity this is not the same as the tortures that cause madness, self harm and voices in someone's head like actual solitary confinement. 

I'm not saying it doesn't suck, i'm not saying it isn't a trial for people. 

but I am saying solitary confinement is actual torture. it's like comparing dunking someone under the water in a pool briefly to waterboarding. It might suck, you may get water up your nose or in your eye's. but it is NOT waterboarding. 

we aren't spending our days hearing our own breathing with blank walls and silence around us, eating flavorless food and our minds so under stimulated we begin to hallucinate. there is a reason deprivation tanks often lead to panic attacks and even worse symptoms if not in the perfect mindset. and hundreds of pandemics and plagues have shown us we can, and have survived with much, much less.

Getting groceries delivered is fine, so is working from home, but even now we have the option to connect to others, online, video calls, phone calls, emails, texts, I mean, you being on reddit for a day is more stimulation than someone in solitary for their entire life would get. 

idle hands are the devils playground is a VERY true statement. Humans, rat's, dogs, even snakes, all animals go crazy when they are deprived stimulation. to the point that just to do or feel something dogs, pigs, rats and humans will mutilate themselves. 

I spent my first winter alone in montana, and it was rough, when the snow dampened the sound and I had nothing to do, no tv, no radio, a flip phone with no one to call. -20 and depressed due to losing my mom, but even just work and what i had laying around gave me enough entertainment to be fine. 

I think you may be panicking and overblowing the situation a little, you just need to take a deep breath and relax, the winter will suck as seasonal depression kicks in, it may be far worse, especially for people who normally have family and friends around. but you need to read and re-read your post title. ""This too shall pass""  

and I see most people who at least didn't lose their jobs, family or have REALLY bad things happen during the pandemic will come out of it making jokes like ""ugh it's friday, JEEZE can we just have another pandemic I need a vacation"" Or ""i've been so busy, classes are wild can we just go back to 2020 so i can listen to class in my PJ's???""

For years after 9-11 there were people comatose on the sofa watching the news in a depressed panic. no one remembers that. No one thinks about it. they say 9-11 never forget but they HAVE forgotten how much it tore a lot of  people up mentally, even those who went through it. 

the suffering will be from the economy (40% of restaurants have closed) millions unemployed, it will be another recession, one far worse than the little 2008 and 2012 ones that left me homeless as a teen. so it will suck for a good while. but it will open doors for a lot of people who are raring to do ANYTHING other than sit on their ass and cruise down their FB feed day after day.","17"

However I don't think it should be permanent for those who prefer being at the office. Even as this pandemic life has had me depressed and struggling mentally, absolutely none of that has been down due to WFH so I guess I am different to you on that. 

For me biggest reasons why I would prefer WFH even beyond all of this: the lack of commute, and also I never really liked socializing with coworkers anyway. 

Lack of commute allows me better and longer sleep, dont have to wake up at 5:30 or 6:00 anymore to go on your 0:45 min drive. Never been a morning person, and that extra 1.5 or 2 hours of sleep would do me really nicely. 

As far as socializing with coworkers, never liked it. Shit is too fake for me, always forced to come up with conversations and also while having to watch what you say. Im not an introvert, anti-social hermit or whatever at all and love socializing (don't know why some like equating not socializing with coworkers with being anti-social and introverted lol) - I just have plenty of friends I actually do like to socialize with and thus I dont have to rely on coworkers to have a social life. Im one of those out on the clock at 5:00 so I can actually spend time with friends and socialize with them. Trying to socialize with coworkers has always been a chore for me and not something I really have time for. Besides, unlike with my friends, I usually have nothing in common with coworkers save for working for the same place, so I don't bother.

Unless you truly are a self-driven person (many people think they are, and many people are wrong) who works primarily in an individual contributor role, you aren't as productive at home as you are in the office. At home we are distracted, less likely to be working as diligently, and far more likely to have communication mixups that take extra time to resolve. 

At the moment, I think that's harder for companies to see. For one thing, their competitors aren't getting ahead by working more efficiently, but for another, people don't have much else to do (so work a ton of extra hours to accomplish the same amount) and are often afraid of losing their jobs. Take that out of the equation, and I have a hard time seeing companies wanting to keep people primarily wfh. Even in the current situation, my partner's company is planning on firing over half their fresh college grads because they aren't getting the work out of them they expect at home (definitely a very crappy situation).

Think of your brain as a worker in the machine that is you. Your brain is trying to process all of your fear of the unknown, and it wants to make you feel more secure. But, all it knows how to do is stuff it has done before, thit situation is unprecedented.

So your brain right now is going ""we are really scared and worried and we can't think of a solution. Best thing we can do is blame ourselves, that way no one else gets hurt and there are LIMITLESS possibilities for how we did this wrong! I'm helping!""

You know your brain is not helping you. But it's doing its best. So now it's your job to steer for your mind. When it starts going, ""but what if?"" You say (even out loud if it helps) ""thank you but no thank you that's not what we're going to do"".

Your father would NOT want you doing this. Your father made a choice and no amount of pressure from you would have changed that. Do not get lost in what ifs. The very person you are ""what iffing "" about would not want you to do this.

Just be very gentle and kind to yourself. You are going through a LOT.","1_1_1_1_1"

I found reading poetry and certain quotes very healing during that time. One main quote I always remind myself when things get overwhelming and hard is Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedomsto choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose ones own way.

You may be feeling overwhelmed and scared and helpless. These are normal but you still have agency in how you react to whats happening and how you handle it and that means youre not so helpless.

In Spain we're not allowed to do this. You will face harsh fines if you go outside just to take a walk. Even in the forest or the beach. On top of that, most people live in apartment buildings here and don't have backyards or even balconies.

A lot of people are in an impossible circumstance right now, facing a number of impossible choices.

If he's in sales, he probably still has certain quotas to meet to keep his job, which I'm sure is also a concern for him.

We're all going through a lot right now. People are losing their jobs. They will lose homes, medical insurance, cars, basic standards of living and even future opportunities for themselves and their children. I understand the fear of that, because I'm going through it to - and I still have a job. What I cannot understand is why anyone would think that endangering another person - to possibly kill  someone - is an appropriate response to that frightening reality. From a moral standpoint, it isn't. You are aware of this, your friend either isn't or made the selfish,  immoral choice. 

I think the real question now is whether or not you can be friends with someone whose moral core is so diametrically opposed to yours. It's not ""agreeing to disagree"", because you don't hang out with people like that and you don't fight with people like that. You avoid them. They tell you with their behavior whether or not they can conduct themselves morally or honorably during times of crisis. He's told  you. 

I'm so sorry you're going through this. Believe it or not, I'm sorry for your friend, too. He made a terrible choice, but by standing by that choice and defending it even though he knows the consequences are potentially deadly for not just his client but also everyone his client has contact with, he's surrendered a large part of his humanity.

The fact that your friend does not see anything wrong with his behavior is the entire issue. Let's face it - it's OK to make mistakes. Literally everyone makes mistakes. Some of the mistakes people make can harm other people. 

What makes it OK to make mistakes is that we generally recognize and acknowledge when we've made a mistake and can therefore avoid making it again.  If you refuse to even acknowledge that you've made a mistake then you can't learn from that experience and avoid repeating the mistake. That's the crux of the  issue - your friend does not see anything wrong with his behavior and doesn't recognize it as a mistake. 
In your friend's own reasoning, it is not a mistake to  endanger the client, the client's family, the client's coworkers and anyone and everyone else the client comes in contact with in the course of their day. 

This  was knowing and intentional, consequences to others be damned. 

If it were a case where your friend said ""I didn't think about it that way and should not have done something that could have harmed or killed others"" then that would be a terrible mistake to make and a good friend would help them through it. But that's now what's going on here. 

I understand how difficult this is for you, and I truly am deeply sorry for both of you. It's hard to lose a friend, but to lose one in such a dramatic fashion has got to be even harder. 

I think, if it were me, I'd tell them one final time that I did care for deeply for them and always wanted only the best for them - which is why it hurt so much that they couldn't see anything wrong with their behavior. Then I'd have the very painful, unpleasant task of telling them that we would have to go our separate ways. That I could not ""make"" them understand that making mistakes is OK - it's human - because we can learn and grow and become better people after we work through it. Their refusal to acknowledge the mistake means they think it is perfectly acceptable to harm others, and that's not how you learn, grow or become a decent human, let alone a better one. 

I'd let them know the hurt it caused me to know that something was preventing them from this opportunity to blossom into something greater than they were before was simply too much to bear and that I could not continue our friendship. 

Then I would mourn. I would mourn the devastating loss of such a key part of my life. Then life would go on, less rich and full for a while with plenty of tender spots to remind me of the severity of the injury, but it would still go on. 

I went through something similar over 20 years ago. It was nowhere as dramatic as your experience, but it was clear that we were on two radically different personal paths. It still hurts sometimes, but that is a pain I am willing to bear because I know it is LESS than the pain of  watching someone you love and care about so very deeply reveal an inexcusable level of immorality you did not previously realize was even there - and then giving your stamp of approval to such behavior by remaining friends with them. That's something I personally cannot do without feeling as if I've surrendered all the best parts of my own humanity - and that would not exactly promote a healthy friendship. 

I truly am sorry. I do understand how painful it is for everyone involved. I think that since your best friend truly cannot see or even refuses to acknowledge the wrongness of their incredibly dangerous actions then the friendship is already over. You just need to take a step back and give yourself time to mourn. 

Be well, be safe - and be kind to yourself. You're going through a lot right now, so please remember to love and care for yourself as well. You have value too, you know. e","12_1_1"

Medical professionals would absolutely agree with your stance because they have repeatedly stressed reducing the spread by avoiding what your friend has done. Globally, most governments have been urging people to stay home and stay isolated for a reason. It doesn't matter if she tested negative or not; for all they knew, she could've been infected and he could've been a-symptomatic, furthering the spread and possibly inflicting a potentially fatal and at the very least, incredibly painful virus on not one person but several. That blatant disregard means he didn't care about someone else's life, their family's life, his life, or even his own  family. He had no way of knowing if his client was infected either. There is absolutely no reason why meeting his client couldn't have taken place through an online app with a webcam. Anyone would understand the precautions right now and that's exactly why most business and classes are being done online- to reduce spread. Your friend seems selfish, reckless and quite frankly, narcissistic.. The fact he has to keep having the last word and insists that no one was harmed after the fact, makes it seem like he's justifying his behavior- which reinforces that he really just didn't care.

I'd drop him. Life is way too short to keep people around who don't value others or you. Think about it- if he was meeting one of your family members, how would that make you feel? That goes for anyone else in the comments who doesn't see this as a big deal. If his friend was potentially a-symptomatic and you knew his wife was sick..would YOU be ok with meeting him? Would YOU be ok with a family member meeting him?","13"

I honestly had to end a ""friendship"" (was more of an acquaintance honestly) because this guy who was into me said ""hey wanna ignore social distancing and hang out this weekend"" and when I told him no and that it upset me he got all defensive as if he wasnt in the wrong. he blocked me. good riddance I say, honestly, if you have no disregard for the safety of others what makes you think I'm going to enjoy your company? 

luckily for me since I didnt know the guy wellenough it wasnt a big loss whereas your situation is different with a best friend. I don't know your friend and the level of friendship you two have  but I suppose you have to look at it and really decide for yourself, is this the kind of person you want to be around? is his behavior excuseable? can you really let this one slide, will you be mad at him 3 months from now for it?

I was flabbergasted that he had invited us, and asked him if he had symptoms. Come to find out he had been having symptoms on and off for weeks when he asked us to hang out. I was really upset at his lack of awareness and even more upset that he was willing to put us knowingly at risk just to have a game night. We have been friends for many years, and it really made me question what type of person he was and if he would have our best interest in mind in other areas of our friendship that involved honesty. 

You are rightfully upset, your friend could have likely done the same meeting with the client safely over zoom or the phone. There is rarely a need to meet face to face nowadays, and if so he should have made it where there could be a protective barrier of some sort or have informed the client of his wifes state and let them decide how they want to proceed with meeting. He was wrong and should have handled matters differently.

Especially if your sources of information are main news sources. You have every right to think however you want to. This sounds like a lower risk situation to me, personally. It sounds like the husband was taking safety precautions and whoever he meets is assuming the risk meeting with him. Also, it is entirely possible to maintain distancing during a client meeting and reduce risk. I get that some folks are asymptomatic carriers and all but this is a situation that sounds low risk to me - COVID not confirmed and not meeting enough criteria to warrant testing, no one else in the family presenting with similar symptoms, wife improving rather quickly. I mean, Im an essential employee and am around people everyday and it isnt necessarily a death sentence, you know? At the hospital I work at we have seen far, far more deaths from us reducing services to those without COVID than actual COVID. These deaths would not have happened otherwise. So, I think your friend should be free to weigh the advantages versus disadvantages of his own unique situation and make the best decision for himself, his family, and his client. His client may really, really, really want to see him and his client is aware of the risks. I really, really, really wanted to see my acupuncturist who helps a ton with my pregnancy. I didnt see her for over a month but now the risk of not seeing her I think outweigh the benefit and I signed a form acknowledging I assume the risk and I saw her today, each of us wearing masks and she sterilized the heck out of everything. You may not actually be aware of all the factors being weighed by your friend in his decision making. You have every right to judge him and stop being his friend because of this. But, he isnt a murderer in my books.","30"

I work in a totally different field, IT, and have always wondered how a person could command a classroom.  I just push a computer around.

Sometimes, it felt like I had ear muffs on, too.  Or was I just under water?  The first times I worked from home, I had a broken foot, and a broken heart.  My baby was just a few months old, and I had just been on maternity leave.  I could not carry my baby because my arms were carrying crutches.  My baby was at daycare.  Now years later, as I transitioned to working from home full time, I was desperately isolated and alienated, even though I have gotten better at it.

There is absolutely no doubt that being overweight significantly increases your risk of serious complications if you catch COVID19, as well as putting you more at risk from other conditions that will also make you more vulnerable to COVID19:

[https://www.worldobesity.org/news/obesity-and-covid-19-policy-statement](https://www.worldobesity.org/news/obesity-and-covid-19-policy-statement)

Having said that, it is important to still consider the risks in context, in particular how much an increase in risk due to obesity puts you at risk in general. There are a range of studies looking at this, which estimate the increased risk to be somewhere around 40-50% (so for instance, if the risk of death for your age group if you contract COVID19 is estimated to be around 1 in 500 ([https://www.statista.com/chart/20860/coronavirus-fatality-rate-by-age/](https://www.statista.com/chart/20860/coronavirus-fatality-rate-by-age/) or [https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid#case-fatality-rate-of-covid-19-by-age](https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid#case-fatality-rate-of-covid-19-by-age)), adding obesity to this makes it 1 in 300. Other estimates have suggested that obesity essentially adds 8-10 years to your natural age, which could push you up into a higher risk age group - at your age, this has about the same impact (40%) but as people get towards the higher risk age groups, this could be more dramatic - if pushed someone in their 50s into the 60s risk group, for example, their risk is increased from around 1 in 250 to 1 in 50. The risk for your age group is not particularly high, so increasing that 40% is still not making it particularly high. 

Secondly, you can take precautions and keep yourself safe even if other around you aren't, so you can go out relatively safely depending on the context. You don't really need to freak out if you see someone else at a grocery store not wearing a mask as long as you stay 2m away from them, you're close to them for less than 10-15 minutes, and wearing a face covering yourself will reduce your risk even if the other two can't be maintained. Similarly for a movie - look at what precautions the theatre is taking and whether these are adequate or not for your level of risk and risk appetite. Going to the mall with your kids is relatively safe as long as you follow precautions and much easier for you to control. The movie theatre and (indoor) restaurant less so as you can't control who you'll be close to for a longer period. If you dine out, try to do so outside on in a restaurant that has tables well spaced out and/or perspex screens and booths between tables. 

Why not use the opportunity the pandemic is giving you to reassess your health to combine this with a great day out with your family - go for a walk on a country trail, or play frisbee etc in the local park? There are lots of ways you can go out safely with your family and improve your health at the same time. It sounds as if you're doing great so far - keep up what you're doing and you'll be fine!","2"

I just recently read an article about visiting restaurant being one of the more risky behaviors (this is not the one I originally read, but on the same topic: [https://www.upi.com/Health\_News/2020/09/10/Bars-restaurants-are-COVID-19-infection-hotspots-study-confirms/6691599773114/](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/09/10/Bars-restaurants-are-COVID-19-infection-hotspots-study-confirms/6691599773114/))

Which makes complete sense, since you can't wear a mask while eating and we know mask wearing to be a usefull prevention measure.

I think it is entirely reasonable to remain cautious. I have noticed many people getting careless, or using the ""nothing has happened to me yet, so I don't need to be carefull"" argument. (Which is complete bs, just to be clear. I have not been in any traffic accidents in my entire life, but that doesn't mean I will stop looking left and right before I cross the street, because that would be insane.) 

The situation with Covid is largely unchanged since March, even heavily affected countries are nowhere near herd immunity, we still have no vaccine and our options for medication are still fairly limited. Many people however seem to have gotten a false sense of security, since they have not been personally affected yet.

By now I am a little bit of an outcast in part of my social circle, many people there have not adjusted their behavior at all, apart from what is mandatory in my country, so I don't meet them often and when I do I meet them outside and with a distance. It is kind of sad, that many of them tell me things like ""I have met so many people this week alone and I am fine"" and they don't even realise that that is the exact kind of behavior that compels me to keep my distance, not shake hands ect. Sometimes this makes me sad, I would rather meet with my friends and not have them think that I am crazy. But sadly many of them are in fact behaving somewhat crazy by being so reckless and I decided to not let myself be convinced by this normalisation of recklessness for the sake of personal comfort.

I hope you can maintain the confidence to stay safe aswell, even if people try to push you to actions that are risky.","6"

I AM the wife you described with kids age 2 and 4 at home and you have described very similarly what my husband has shared with me semi-recently. We kept both kids home in 2020-2021 from preK and daycare. We have, however, been on a few dates and have traveled with strict masking and testing involved. My husband recently shared with me some of the feelings you expressed and I had literally NO idea he was suffering as he truly hadnt mentioned how he was feeling up until about a month ago.

Is there family who is vaccinated you could start visiting again? Even if you wear masks?

Are there outdoor activities / dates you can plan for the springtime? A date in the park? A baseball game? A concert? Outdoor dining? Yes, its a group of people which is risky, but outdoor transmission is incredibly low and Im assuming you and your wife are boosted if youve been taking things this seriously?? 

For family outings.. maybe the zoo or a drive in movie theater? We brought our kids to the zoo last week when it was 50° here in New England and the sunshine and normalcy was so welcome. 

My husband and I also discussed community transmission rates we were comfortable with to try indoor dining again. If I didnt set a benchmark for myself, Id always think its too soon. We personally decided percent positivity under 5% and we would do indoor activities with a mask and under 1% and wed return to indoor dining. Maybe cases per 100k is a better measure? But regardless.. maybe try bringing up some talk of future plans when cases settle down in your area. Were never going to have zero covid and if/when your county is lower risk, its reasonable to start resuming some normal pre-covid events.

I don't want to make my wife out to be the villain or anything. I understand her reasoning and I get it. I just have this ever sinking feeling that we are doing this wrong and it's gotten to a point where it's going to socially stunt the kids and the lack of extended family is going to impact them negatively. She's perfectly fine being in the house all day every day. She's fine with not seeing family as she's not close to hers and didn't grow up like I did. She's okay with the girls not have social interactions because she says they are so young that it won't effect them in the long run.

We are just different in that aspect.

We live in Oklahoma so all the boomer ass rednecks around us want to make sure we stay a ""High Risk"" county and stifle any sort of progress. But, yeah... She may be fine with me masking up and going to hang out with my friends. I'd be the only person in a mask and it would be real awkward. My friends are great but I would get a hella ribbing from them for wearing a mask when it's just me and them chilling in their house.  I suppose that's just something I'd have to deal with.

Maybe I'll talk to her about some sort of date night outside or something. It's just really really cold here right now but that'll change soon. She also requires my mom to quarantine for a few days and then take a test before she drives up here and that's not always doable for her as she does live her life normally. She's the only baby sitter we would have if we went out.

I know shes not the villain at all and that you both are doing what you think is best for your family.. You really could be describing my husband and I throughout this pandemic. I have never been close with my family and am introverted. I could quarantine another 2 years and be totally happy but my husband is super social and very close with his family and this has been understandably quite hard on him while I truly am fine for the most part. I think its harder when you do have differing levels of extroversion or need for social outings/connection.

Ugh that sucks that youre in an area that will be later on to see case counts fall. Fingers crossed they do fall eventually for you!! 

I wonder if a rapid test upon entry for your mom (but no quarantine?) would be an area you could compromise on? If case counts get low enough? The no babysitter thing truly sucks. We have limited family support. We are lucky enough to know a college aged student who we trust who watches our kids during the summer and over winter break for an occasional date night. It was definitely easier with her to ask her to mask and do a rapid test than it has been with family because we were paying her haha.

It sounds like you care a lot about your family and your partner, so if youre able to bring up some concerns/ideas, maybe there is an area or two where you can reevaluate together and take a step or two closer to normalcy. Even if its just a singular date night, night with friends, or a family outing. Your mental health is 100% worth the difficult and uncomfortable conversation(s) it may require to begin slowly resuming some preferred activities.

Im so, so hopeful the vaccine for our kids gets approved soon. Its the one thing holding our family back still from fully returning to normal and it really sucks.

The statistics are looking very promising across the board for the first time in a long time. Even after vaccinations things didn't look as good as they do now.

But, having said that, your baby is not at risk. From the very beginning of the pandemic, it has been absolutely clear that COVID19 poses virtually no risk to healthy babies and children. Similarly, if you and your husband are fully vaccinated there is equally little risk to you. Your SIL is also correct that having had COVID19 she has natural immunity.

So, from a health perspective there isn't a strong reason to deny her access to her niece.

But, you have been deeply scarred by the loved ones you've lost to COVID19 and you every right to dislike people who are hesitant to be vaccinated. Such people don't put put you and your baby at risk but they do put other more vulnerable people at risk and you have a right to stand against her position from that point of view.

Which means that in some ways you are holding her to ransom - ""get vaccinated or you're not seeing the baby"" - but you have every right to.

Perhaps explain it to her in those terms - she will be travelling to see you, and risks infecting others along the way. You don't want any family to feel as bad as you when your loved ones died and it hurts you that she doesn't feel the same way.

If she doesn't budge, you have every right to say no to her visiting.

I am also 23F, never tested positive for covid until last week.Like you, I was genuinely shocked to see the positive test result on my rapid test because my symptoms were so mild. I did have a scratchy throat, and then a dry cough for two days, but that honestly felt like a mild convenience more than anything else and I was able to treat my symptoms with dayquil/nyquil and flonase for mild congestion. I also had my second dose in April, but I did take my booster on 10/30/21 since I'm a teacher (was able to get the booster earlier).

Still trying to find out how I was exposed. My symptoms first showed on 12/20 and I tested positive on 12/21, so I figured I caught covid VERY recently. One of my roommates (no booster) had a fever earlier that week but tested negative for covid and most likely had the flu. The only people I had been around that entire weekend was my other roommate and her BF, but they never showed symptoms and never tested positive (they also have the boosters).

The only thing that has made sense to me is I accidentally caught it from one of my students at school (two staff members did test positive the week prior but I never had any contact with them). I'm guessing I caught covid either 12/16 or 12/17 from one of my students. Feels like a total crapshoot tbh but I'm glad that I had stayed home that entire time from 12/17 to when I got tested.

The only thing that sucked is I canceled my flight to see my family for christmas (I live across the country lol). My dad and aunt have preexisting health conditions (diabetes) and are also a lot older and although they're both triple vaxxed I didn't want to risk giving them covid since I'm also triple vaxxed + all the other people I could've infected at the airport. My symptoms were gone by 12/25 though! Technically 12/30 would end my 10 days of quarantine but tbh I don't have any new years plans anyway.

Hopefully you are able to recover soon!","8"

while on the greater scale the amount of active positive cases on that day was 224 so at that point the actual mortality rate (which if you're going to look at a single day, is deaths divided by active cases by the end of that day) based on the official numbers for that day was only 3% on that day

There is - genuinely - no evidence that the surgical masks healthcare workers need have the slightest impact on members of the public. In fact, from previous outbreaks there is evidence that they can actually make things worse, as they can give those wearing them a false sense of security (and thus less likely to observe social distancing, regular hand washing etc). The honest position is - there is no scientific evidence that they have any value for the wider public. But fear, unscrupulous mask manufacturers/scared people turn that into conspiracies. If you want to cover your mouth with a scarf, go ahead. If you want to waste your money on surgical masks when there are enough for everyone who wants, rather than needs, one, go ahead.

Guidance on mask wearing is being critically re-reviewed, said Robert Redfield, director of the C.D.C.

[...] Dr. Fauci said: The idea of getting a much more broad communitywide use of masks outside of the health care setting is under very active discussion at the task force. The C.D.C. group is looking at that very carefully.
Masks work by stopping infected droplets spewing from the wearers nose or mouth, rather than stopping the acquisition of the virus from others. Both medical grade N95 masks and flat face masks are made of a special melt-blown fabric, which is able to stop infectious particles even finer than a micron in diameter. But in many Asian countries, where everyone is encouraged to wear masks, the approach is about crowd psychology and protection.
If everyone wears a mask, individuals protect one another, reducing overall community transmission. And places like Hong Kong and Taiwan that jumped to action early with social distancing and universal mask wearing have gotten their cases under much greater control.
There have been troubling reports that indicate the coronavirus may be able to travel farther in the air and stay in the environment longer than is possible by respiratory droplets, which have so far been assumed to be the primary mode of transmission of the virus.

new study from the French doctor on the forefront of coronavirus treatment shows that 97.5%  of patients who received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin improved (emphasis added):

&gt;    Today, Prof. Didier Raoult and his team published results of their new study. The study was supported by the Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire (IHU) Méditerranée Infection. Unlike the previous small study trial, the new observation study has a larger sample size of 80 COVID-19 patients. The objective of the study was to find an effective treatment to cure COVID-19 patients and to decrease the virus carriage duration.
&gt;
&gt;    In 80 in-patients receiving a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, the team found a clinical improvement in all but one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74-year old patient still in intensive care unit. The team also found that, by administering hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin, they were able to observe an improvement in all cases, except in one patient who arrived with an advanced form, who was over the age of 86, and in whom the evolution was irreversible, according to a new paper published today in IHU Méditerranée Infection.","9"

Contact the hospital to make sure they are actually allowing visitors for covid patients. Then contact your grandma's care staff and ask if they think you will be able to visit her this weekend. If there is any hesitation in their answers: go visit her now. The honest answer is that we can't always tell who will recover and who won't. 

If she is placed on a ventilator or if the staff want to place her on a ventilator and she refuses the vent: this is a bad sign. With the delta variant going around, unvaccinated folks who need ventilation tend to not recover from this.

I am so sorry. Your grandma's prognosis is honestly pretty bleak. It isn't hopeless, but statistically speaking, the odds are not in her favor.

Your mother is going to have life long health consequences. She is also going to be at a much higher risk of stroke. She needs to be working closely with her doctor to manage her health. The best you can do is encourage her to see her doctor and to listen to what her doctor says.

Something you learn in support groups for friends and family of addicts is that you can't make the addict do anything. Their behavior is beyond your control. You can't force someone to get sober, they have to want to get sober. The best you can do is protect yourself, and be part of a support group than encourages sobriety without enabling them in their habits. You never had the ability to make your mother or grandmother get vaccinated. They had to want to do it.

I am from the greater nyc area as well and, liberal or not, this virus is not a political issue. It is a public health issue. I think that if people put themselves and others at risk, it says something about them. Morally. Does it mean they are INHERENTLY BAD and I believe they deserve to get extremely sick and possibly die?? Absolutely not. Anyone who does believe that also has issues on a moral level. Even the dumbest, most ignorant of them out there, I still do not believe they deserve to get sick. I believe they are being misled by this government and the media they follow, and those around them that do the same, and I truly feel terrible for themespecially when they get sickespecially because I also got sick and it was not a joke. I am also young and relatively healthy, but definitely could have died. I had severe pneumonia. I got it when it hit NYC in March and masks were not a known importance. 

Maybe youre not liberal, but you still got covid. Maybe I am liberal, I also got covid. This isnt politics this is public health. You see now that, even with some caution, you have succumbed to this virus. Youre healthy and, sick like a dog, so perhaps you can understand why this virus is supposed to be taken as seriously as it is in some places, because not everyone is maybe as healthy as you are. 

I was also recently in the south. I went from the epicenter, to being super sick, then traveling to SC once I was cleared for contagion because I was moving to the west coast and was too sick to drive all the way through. While I was there the virus became a serious issue because of the huge political divide, which is just fcking stupid, and I found it to be a land of ignorant defiance, in a sea of people also trying to keep themselves safe because others were purposely NOT trying to keep themselves or anyone safe. Circumstances made moving west a bad idea, so Im actually back north. I was in the south for a few months and the relief I felt coming back north where face masks were MANDATORY and still are made me feel like I could breathe againalbeit under my mask. 

If your friends were to think badly of you because you ended up in the hospital, it says something bad about them. I hope you get better quickly, and I also hope that you decide to do a little better with covid safety moving forward if you werent doing enough before. 

I truly hope you get well very soon.

It's much better to keep your distance and make sure you're out of harm's way.

Daycare can be a toss up and I get you're apprehension. I'm not a father, but I primarily work in close proximity with children and young adults in private instruction. My students are always masked up and at a distance with hand sanitizer beside their chair. I have students as young as 4 and I tell you right now that they stick their hands everywhere they shouldn't, *but you know that I'm sure.* Little buggers are just asking to get sick! and seeing the really young ones with the mask being consumed happens often *(kind of funny honestly) ...*

I talk with parents of young kids on a daily basis and they face a similar struggle balancing their work life and homelife during the pandemic. I often ask them how they do it and how they managed to stay sane during this hectic time. The most common answer isn't day care, but having a babysitter. These parents already are worried about their kids bringing home covid from school, so I surmise many don't want to pop kids in daycare. I spoke with a young single father of a 6 year old girl and he told me just a few hours a couple days a week he has local girl come watch and hangout with his daughter. It gave him time to himself and let his daughter burn off energy in a safe supervised environment. Perhaps consider looking into a local sitter you can trust? Many young adults and teenagers willing to babysit can be found on websites and local groups like Facebook (*I hate that site too)!* A lot of parents also enroll students with me with the intention of getting a little break and having some form of enrichment for their kids in a safe one on one environment. 

I often watch my brothers kids who are around the same age and the first thing I do even if its winter is get them outside and moving around. It's good for me too and going for a walk or pushing a stroller is a nice break. I guess just try and get crafty with how you get your kiddo engaging with activities. Also, don't worry about if you're being right or wrong. You clearly have your Childs best interest in mind and it is normal to get frustrated. Having a toddler is like having a puppy that doesn't grow up fast, that's challenging. If daycare really is the best fit then I say go for it. If you're running out of options you gotta do what you gotta do. Just make sure everything is on the up and up. 

Best of luck to you man.","3"

My LDR relationship has grown stronger I think, and if that can happen instead of going the opposite direction in the year weve had I feel thats a sign we can survive almost anything together.

On the other hand, In the last year Ive had several relapses in my depression and nearly constant anxiety. One episode was because my dog passed suddenl in really traumatic circumstances and I wasnt there to say goodbye to her. I have seen my family since 2019 and have no idea when I will be able to. My LDR is also a waiting game. All the activities Ive done to previously cope with my mental state has been relegated to my living room (gym and ballet) which has me feeling frustrated and like Im getting worse at it, so Ive lost the motivation to do it.

Ive also developed a much harsher view on society, especially in the country Im currently in. Yes you have those who follow the rules and behave in a way that is for the collective good, but youve also got so many of those who dont give a sh*t and do what they want even if it means putting someones life at risk. Even worse that its people I was previously close to (one person told me how she went to a rave at the start of lockdown because its just a flu)

I know everybody is optimistic with the vaccines and the government have announced the roadmap out of lockdown. I had an anxiety attack when it was announced. If its going to be anything like it was last summer when restrictions were relaxed, Im not sure I can handle it.

In July we had to take pay cuts but it was OK since I'm fairly frugal anyway and giving up takeout food was the only sacrifice we had to make as a result.

Things went to hell in November. My mom died and then my mother-in-law died of COVID in January. Since then, I've gained 15 pounds, sleep 12 hours a day, and only get out of bed at all to work and feed the dogs. Cry a lot. Have been talking to a grief counselor.

Society has created a system where we feel like we need to be doing stuff all the time or being productive. If you don't want to do something or get lazy or tired that's okay because we shouldn't be determining our worth on what we do anyway. This whole quarantine thing was really hard for me too bc i felt like i should be doing stuff with my time, getting things done, focusing on hobbies, etc. But the feeling that we \*should\* be doing this is an aggressive thought towards ourselves by trying to make us be or do something different than what we already are. Regardless, it's understandable that you want to explore stuff in your life. My suggestion is to take just 5-10 minutes trying or doing one of those things you say you want to do or trying something new. It's surprising how much you can do in a short period of time. If you get tired or lazy after that, it's okay. Slow and steady wins the race.","1_1_1"

when I was bored a few years ago and feeling like I didn't do much with my time, I joined an animal rights group and did some work for them (like packing donations and posting stuff on their facebook page), it doesn't always have to be a creative hobby.

but it's hard to suggest things to you without knowing you, maybe you can brainstorm a little with friends or talk a little about yourself here :)

in the end you just have to pick something and try it out - maybe something you don't think you'll enjoy, you might be surprised. and remember that you don't waste your time when you do something you enjoy. we're not on this planet too achieve anything at work, we're here to enjoy ourselves - at least that's what I believe :)","1_1_2"

Remember: people's lives always look more exciting on social media. I myself only post the good, memorable moments and the other not-so-great moments stay private.

What helps me is setting a positive intention for each day and creating a loose but structured schedule (esp. if you're unemployed or working from home). For example, early morning is wake-up / shower / get dressed / self-care, late morning is work time, noon is lunch, early afternoon is creative time (for projects or games), and late afternoon is exercise and outdoors time, etc.

A positive intention I might set for myself is to learn how to bake lemon poppyseed bread, or reorganize the dresser, or reconnect with an old friend or family member. These small accomplishments make you feel productive and can inspire even more.

Hope that's a helpful start!

EDIT: Additionally, I struggle with perfectionism and anxiety (they're definitely cousins!), which might be something you share. It's especially hard to cope with during quarantine!

The people getting aid and not working will eventually run out and that is terrifying so every single day my suggestion would be to write down at least 3 things youre grateful for right now. Gratitude is transformative if you make it a practice. You will magnetize better things for yourself. So yes you might feel super grateful you have an at home job and security. Meanwhile when we go into lockdown it can be a transformative time within your own self as well. I personally believe this is a gifted time if we let it be. We all could to be looking at what is important for each of us, what is and isnt working, what are our gifts and passions, how can we contribute to self love/self-care and how can we contribute to society. Many of us are feeling lost and trying to navigate this new era. Its important to allow yourself time to breathe and just feel low or no motivation and be ok with it for a little while. Earth is grieving. Let yourself grieve for a little while then get more support to carve out self care for yourself. Like today I will take 1 hour a day to journal my feelings or whats going on, write a gratitude list, read a book, meditate, do some yoga, take a walk in nature, write down thoughts of what you could do if money or time were no object, what do you love to do and can lose yourself in? Then take time to connect with friends or family. Basically allow yourself time to do nothing, to be lazy, to eat crap BUT a limited time then get back to finding even 1 self care thing and it should grow from there hopefully. Allow yourself time for self introspection of what you want your life to look like. Sometimes writing down what you dont like first helps get you going. Just be gentle with yourself, youre not alone. We will get through this. Good job for reaching out! If you feel depressed BetterHelp is available 2 week free trial I think and Im pretty sure there is a free Covid stress mental health hotline if youre having too tough of a time depending on where you live. Hang tight! You got this! =ª==O","3"

We were hesitant but we masked as soon as we left the car at the airport and the whole time we were at Disney, even when we were outside. What we found was no one cared you were sitting on a bench, they will come right in front of you to plan their next ride instead of like 5 feet to the side of you where there was space. So instead of confronting them, we would  roll our eyes are each other and just move. But a lot of people didn't care about personal space. Also flew for a family vacation in August.

Good for you!

But also, what people do is bigger than you, it's not that they don't care about you specifically with these actions, it's that they don't really care about how the actions can impact anyone in society. You're not the only one they'd be putting at risk. I don't think it's that they don't personally care about you more so than it is they are somewhat selfish in their actions, aka it is more about them than you and doing what they want regardless of what is going on. But it sucks because you want them to consider you and feel like they should (which, IMO, they definitely should).

My degree was in intercultural comm, and if you're in the US,  a HUGE issue is individualism vs collectivism. People in America are incredibly individualistic for the most part (put themselves first), whereas as a lot of other cultures that are collectivistic (meaning about the group first before the self) are taking it more seriously, i.e. majority of Asian cultures are collectivistic , and those countries are doing well. There is also a ton of research on already out about how this is a driving force behind people's behavior during the pandemic.

My little family has been isolating since Feb/March as well. My 6 yr old gets pneumonia several times a year, she was going to get tested this spring to see if theres something else wrong why she gets it so much.... but we have put off tests until things at least calm down in our town. Of course, they havent at all. We live in the south, at the beach- so basically everyone rich exiled here from NYC and brought it with them and then all the dummies here just dont care enough and it spread all summer long. We had maybe one actual month of lockdown back in March and people lost their minds but still went out and did things. Theyd post pictures of social distancing were hugging a group of 10 outside at a happy hour. Its just all been so maddening. Most people dont bother to mask here, even indoors. So we dont go anywhere. Ive literally just this week let us go to a few drs appts but even that has me nervous. Im so angry and frustrated. Im homeschooling my little ones but I feel heartbroken for them that we cant even find one other family thats like us, not seeing others and just carrying on with life like its normal. I probably should just delete my social media accounts because I dont think I can take another picture of people having a big birthday party or going on vacation with friends post. I honestly knew most of the people I know here are garbage though because when a tree fell on our house last year during hurricane Dorian - no one offered any help. All the neighbors and friends that we hosted yearly big events and parties and dinners at our house- none could even care enough to drop by and ask if we needed anything or even directly send a text to check in. So that was an eye opener of how disgustingly selfish people are. But this whole pandemic has pushed me over the edge honestly, I think I need to move away to the mountains, lol.","16"

Self-care, listening to yourself, and being forgiving when things don't shake out perfectly is more important. Quarantine is going to be rough for a lot of people. 

I've worked from home for years and am mildly agoraphobic, so I've probably spent a lot more time inside than most. It takes a really long time to set up a strict schedule you can stick to - longer than most people will be isolated. Set up some goalposts, opt for whatever gives you a sense of normalcy (if you want to order delivery and can afford it, then do it - use common sense as to how much is too much), and understand that this is uncharted territory.

It's not happy go lucky, it's telling it like it is. As someone who has been working from home for a long time during various periods of my life, including the past year or so, and doesn't have much of a social life nor the craving for one - this is actually the mindset you *must* have to be able to do this long-term.

To make it clear: I used to be a freelance translator back when I couldn't even dream of having a laptop so I had to work from home on my PC; then I did various office jobs; now I'm a project manager working from home with regular office time (9 am-6 pm), part by choice part by necessity (I have ulcerative colitis which makes commuting rather shitty, literally, when I have a flare-up). I have ample experience with getting used to this, and it all lines up with what OP wrote.

Unless you're already comfortable with an irregular schedule, you must have self-discipline, create routines and stick to them. You also must remain physically active. My example: during my first stint at working from home I was fairly young, in my 20s. I'm something of a night owl so I kept staying up until dawn screwing around online, then sleeping until noon or later, etc. This resulted in me not really having an incentive to do work because well, by the time I sat down to do it it was already evening and deadline was still a few days away, etc... so my productivity started slipping, this resulted in constant low-key stress and anxiety, not eating well (ordering junk food, or buying ready-made shit at the nearest store), developing back pain/etc. for sitting all day, stress eating, etc. Aside of health issues, due to stress and anxiety I ended up feeling guilty whenever I chatted with someone instead of working, or went out to do whatever, so I got even further isolated. Long story short, I ended up spiraling into depression, and went through a period of insomnia and regular panic attacks. It was a really, *really* shitty time of my life.

I got an office job after that and things improved a bit except the company and my coworkers sucked, but that's another story. I ended up changing companies and working from home again, but by that time I was older and had a clearer picture of the potential pitfalls, health-wise, mentally and physically, so I thought about how I should go about it.

What ended up working was basically developing a routine and sticking with it. Getting up when I normally would to go to the office, instead of like 5 minutes before work starts; doing set amounts of exercise in the morning, mid-day and evening instead of just sitting around; cooking for myself instead of eating junk or ordering meals. Hell, I went from someone who didn't care to cook at all to someone who now finds joy and satisfaction in cooking my own meals (nothing fancy, mind you, I don't care for elaborate recipes). I even made up my own recipes for sweets and junk food so they're less unhealthy, and ended up discovering ways to enjoy foods I hadn't cared about before.

This is a way of self-love, at least it's my way. I'm doing myself the favor of keeping myself on the right track so that my mental and physical health doesn't suffer. Now, I'm very introverted and I don't really crave social contact, at least not physically, so that works in my advantage. But regardless, unless you're the kind of free spirit with boundless creativity, OP's advice is, in fact, pretty sound.

ETA: I'm getting downvoted for this? Amazing. You do you guys, yo do you. I wonder how many people even took the time to actually read what I wrote.","1_3"

Heck, even many people who are used to WFH are stressed right now.

You're not wrong in your general list of advice, but you should realize that this is not the same situation and the sort of people who absolutely hated working from whom before and avoided it at all costs, and are now forced to work from home, are now screwed in a way that you will never be.

Doing things that help you when you have the resources to do so is great. Not everyone has the resources, though, and people with resources telling other people what they should be doing is not helpful at all. It's not lack of self-love to lack resources.

So no, it's not how I had set up my life and career, it's something I had to learn to live with. I told my story to show how it was when I didn't know how to deal with it, and as you can see I didn't deal with it well *at all*. I'm fine *now* but I absolutely didn't use to be.

Also, I understand that not everyone is the same way I am, that's why I mentioned that I have certain things about my personality that work in my advantage. (In certain ways, anyway, because in other ways these things absolutely work against me.) But here's the thing - no matter how much you hate working from home, no matter how much you're stressed by not being able to go out and do shit, this is what you're stuck with now for who knows how long. And yes, I understand that people feel shitty about it, but  this sub is for getting support, right? And in my opinion ""support"" shouldn't mean only venting and distributing virtual hugs. Yes, those are incredibly important, as is the knowledge that you're not alone with feeling shitty, and that it *is* OK to feel shitty. But I think self-love and self-care also includes finding ways to better manage a situation you're stuck with, whether it's having to stay home due to a pandemic, or not being able to leave a job you hate, or having family issues, or having mental or physical issues. Because ultimately that's what will make you feel better in the long run.","1_3_1_1"

I never said this was a happy-go-lucky thing. And I never said it would be easy to do these things. And I never said that I think anyone can just get up and do them all at once. Hell, I cant even do most of these things on certain days. But the point isnt that I or anyone should expect themselves or others to just be able to do these things all at once, consistently, forever and be perfect. 

The point is that doing these things is an ongoing practice. Just do it doesnt mean you need to, or should have to, be a productive worker, or start a business, or be the best person ever. It just means to see whats around you, and in you, that can be fixed. And instead of putting off fixing what can be fixed today, until tomorrow, fix it today. 

And if you understand this, then youll also get that my post specifically does deal with self-love at a lot of points. Staying active and avoiding junk food is self-love. Learning the things youve always wanted to learn, but havent yet, while there is this greater opportunity to do so than there has been before, is self-love. Planning your future, appreciating what youve got, looking at your own faults, facing them, and committing to fix them is self-love.

Like, that is actually _my_ reality. I'm an introvert with a lot of issues, being locked in for a while has been a bit of a toss up for me but overall I'm cooking more, cleaning more, more productive at work, doing more, and generally feeling more stable for some goddamn reason. But I know that's circumstantial and isn't coming from some deep untapped fountain of energy from within me, I just dropped some stressors that for normal people are not stressors so I'm actually ""ahead"" or ""level"".

And here's the thing. It's not about time. It's about energy. Some of us have gotten more time. But some of us have lost a lot of *energy*.

&gt; Staying active and avoiding junk food is self-love. Learning the things youve always wanted to learn, but havent yet, while there is this greater opportunity to do so than there has been before, is self-love.

I'm sorry, but no. Just absolutely no. :|

Self-love is, fundamentally, about accepting yourself as who you are the way you are. As soon as you tie it to *accomplishments*, you're in danger. What if you fail? Then you're screwed. What if you tie your self-worth to that progress? You're screwed. Don't do that, trust me. I've done that for 20 years. I would have made more progress if I accepted my limitations and allowed myself the fact that sometimes the thing that ""could"" be done today just fucking ain't gonna be.

People already naturally do the things that are needed or desirable, to them. If they do not, the issue is not going to be fixed by a pep talk. For those of us who gained energy from this event we're going to go do the extra things anyway because what the fuck else are we going to do but I had days where that was absolutely not the focus. But the problem is not the people and never was the people.

Here's the thing you seem to be missing with all this: pressure, energy, stress. It is understandable because I feel that if you haven't lived it, you don't get it, and often even if you did live it, but it was temporary, you soon forget it.

There are some folks who seem to have infinite energy for everything, nothing ever gets them down, and they just go on forever. That's great, but also isn't, because they seem to raise the minimal standard for the rest of us while we're seeking acceptance and rest in a hyper-productive society. That's what I call ""happy go lucky"". People who just do not seem to empathize with energy problems and don't understand why the rest of us don't just ""do"" it. We get called lazy and selfish when we just plain have less resources.

But humans are not really machines. Humans don't really have infinite capacity for doing all the things they are putting off. Those things are usually getting put off for a reason. I know everyone has that stereotype of a person who just doesn't do anything except they *totally could be* but frankly I have never met that in real life.

Pretty much every person with depression, ADHD, diseases like lupus, who's transitioning, etc., is having to do some levels of energy management, and some are more aware of this than others. That's actually not an insignificant percentage of people.

And there are some people where you put more pressure on them they'll end up doing more and then there's some people where you put more pressure on them and they collapse entirely if it's the wrong kind of pressure. The latter a cool story doesn't make and we don't want to talk about it. When you don't ""really"" have limits, or you just haven't seen them, you just assume all pressure is good. When you do have limits you're hit with the reality that if you try to assign yourself more than you can handle, you'll fall down, so there's a limited amount of ""can handle"" that you have to ration your activities into, because otherwise you'll literally be worse off than if you did nothing at all.

And guess what this pandemic does? Lots and lots of people suddenly end up with a lot of downward pressure that will challenge their energy levels, and some may find out there's a limit and they'll keep trying to do what they're used to doing and find out they just can't.

This also means it's hard to give general advice because people need solutions tailored to them. And I often feel a person who is left alone to figure out what their resources and needs are is able to accomplish this just fine. But if a person is constantly worried they're not doing enough, which many ALREADY ARE, it saps however little energy they already have.

We can't do that.","1_4_1"

Put simply, can is an absolute. Could is ""can"", but with something missing that would otherwise make it absolute.

There's a fairly long history of people with more resources telling people with less resources what they ""can"" do. To the point that the latter group starts believing it and literally thinks they ""can"" do all the things, but just don't, because they're ""lazy"". That's the problem.

[ reality is that people are so routinely asked to do shit not in their best interest that it's generationally internalized to have a messed up relationship as to what you can or can't do without damaging yourself, but I don't want to get into a big diatribe on capitalism here ]

Really, if you legitimately can cook the pot of rices, well why do you not? What is this group of people you're telling to ""just do it"" at that point?

I'll give you a bit of a pass: to some groups of people, a 3rd party telling them ""go do it ffs"" actually _does_ raise their energy levels. So it sometimes works. I think that's ultimately all you're doing here.

I just think that group is not that huge and there's also the group of people that'd be hurt instead, and I don't think that advice is safe to deliver due to this factor.","1_4_1_1_1"

So, I'll go ahead and admit it. My argument fails when it becomes me deciding what you ""can"" do. 

Where it does work, however, is not just in people who are unconscious of their untapped energy reserves (where a very small amount of ""just go do it ffs"" does work), but also who are conscious of their own untapped energy but refuse to use it to be better (people who are truly lazy).

The problem becomes a problem, when I (being an outsider to each person's subjective experience) can't tell who is unconscious of their untapped energy or not. So I, based on my own experience as someone who once spent life largely in that state of mind, laid out what I had learned, and how to learn it, so that others like me could do the same.

But paradoxically, by doing so, then others who are genuinely unable to tap into energy reserves - because they have none - see my post as just some asshole telling them what to do. 

The irony lies in the fact that I myself was once totally aware of my untapped potential, but chose not to pursue it because I had grown *too* comfortable with my prior state of having not enough energy. 

The ultimate point being, no matter how I were to phrase my argument, someone will *see* me as wrong where I may be right, and someone will not admit their own wrong where they know I am right. Likewise, I might not *see* myself as wrong where others may be right, and I might not admit my own wrong where I know others are right.

I can't change the first three outcomes, but I can choose to pick the fourth, which I'm trying to do now and I've been trying to do throughout my comments on this post. Will everyone see that and acknowledge my own acknowledgement of me and my argument's faults and in turn, do the same for theirs? No. Will me spelling this out seem like I'm elevating myself morally above some people? Yeah. 

But at the end of the day, as long as someone gets it, I'm happy. Even if that person is only me. It's better, though, when someone else gets it, and I'm glad that whether it's you or someone else who might come along later, you do.","1_4_1_1_1_1"

For the majority of my life, my isolation wasnt my choice. It was imposed on me by people who saw me as anything ranging from, Oh him? Yeah, he doesnt know any better, hes... you know... *whispering* retarded...; to That guy is so weird, and kinda creepy. Lets totally avoid ever talking to him; to That guy is weird, but kinda cool. I do want to learn more about him, but more out of curiosity and the novelty of having an autistic friend than out of genuine care or interest; to pretty much any other number of things. 

But after a long while of my life feeling so out of touch with everyone around me, I mentally kinda broke. I had a time where I was bitter. Despite my lifelong desire to be part of, and accepted by, a larger group (whether it was friends, society, school, work, etc.) and following all of the textbook steps on politeness, sociable behavior, etc. I still wasnt accepted. It was only after having decided to just say fuck it and spend my life alone that I was forced to look back and think about why things were the way they were, and whatever role I had to play in them.

And eventually I realized my role was something I wasnt even aware of, fully, that I had been doing. I was trying so hard to fit the mold that I totally neglected to realize how much I needed to be genuine to myself and to others, equally. 

This meant changing my entire outlook on life. Getting fit no longer meant I would do it to impress other people. It meant I would do it to impress myself with my progress, and from there hope to inspire other people to do the same. Ive since fallen way far behind in my fitness because of other health issues, but thats ok. 

Because Ive also taken the time to learn. Whereas school and community college didnt work out for me because I felt forced into it, and all of the socializing that comes with it - worrying about whether or not Ill pass a test, get to class on time, be forced into a group assignment, or have to pick between class and my friendships; learning because I want to, about subjects that I find interesting, satisfies me and helps me learn much more effectively. And I encourage others use what works for them to learn too. Because a very important thing I happened to learn is that everyone learns differently, so just because school didnt work out for me doesnt mean it wont for someone else. Either way though, I wouldnt have had the drive to learn in the first place if not for whatever I had been able to learn in school. So when I, in my OP, encourage you to take this isolation to learn, the deeper meaning behind the methods I myself outlined is that you shouldnt let your learning stagnate, even in times and situations where learning is uncomfortable. You might not have the best learning environment for yourself right now, and thats fine. Still, keep trying. 

Which then leads to the last major point I made in my OP, and how it ties back with my own isolation. I wished for so long someone had taught me these things. But in a sudden sort of ah-ha! moment, I realized they had. It was my refusal to listen which made me less than genuine to myself. Which then came off in how I acted around others. 

So now socializing with me still tends to have the same result as before: most people who meet me face to face, dont like me. Most people I talk to online, dont like me or what I have to say. But thats ok. My attitude has shifted from wanting to belong with the people who dont accept me, because I couldnt accept myself; to being ok with spending more time alone, even when I dont necessarily want to, so I can continue to learn and grow. And now when I do talk to people, sure, they sometimes dont want to have anything to do with me. But Im ok with it, because Im comfortable in my own skin. And Im also ok with other people not wanting to do with me, when they are comfortable in their own skin. And when my comfort ends up leading to stagnation, I give some of that comfort to people who dont have it. Even though it can be painful for me personally, the reward is that I continue to learn and grow.","5_1"

As others have pointed out, thankfully, I myself am lucky and privileged in other ways which they're not, though. 

Unfortunately, it's impossible to actually go in and have an objective measure of how much or how little and in what areas someone is privileged, and where they aren't.

I made this post, and I stand by my message, because I am privileged to have had the specific life circumstances which have let me know that what I'm saying is right. I'm also standing by it, because I was at one time the exact sort of person who I today call lazy. I knew that what I was saying now is true on some level, but my own comfort with the attitude I had previously (when I *could not* do things) made me reject the reality that at that point I had say, ""I *can* do things,"" even though saying it was uncomfortable as fuck.

But I'm also acknowledging my own privilege when I openly say in the comments of this post that, yeah - not everyone who reads my OP are in the position where they can do things. And that is ok. I know my OP made that not clear, but my replies in the thread were me trying my best to make it more clear.

Still, other people are reading this with the same mindset I had when I was lazy. There are some people in this thread who *do* know that they *can* do things. But their comfort with the way things were when they *couldn't* do things has led to the originally valid words of ""I can't,"" still being said, but whose meaning is twisted. Instead of it meaning, ""I lack the knowledge, resources, and tools to do these things,"" what it might now mean to them is, ""I know I can do these things, but I won't, because I'd have to give up my comfort"".

No matter what, I myself know that there's something in my message for everyone. If you're the sort of person who can't do things, and knows it, then my message can be summed up with, ""it's ok, just do things little by little and eventually you'll get there.""

If you're the type of person who reads this and knows you can do things, but refuses to do them out of an excess of comfort (aka genuinely lazy) then my message is, get off your ass and do what you need to do.

If you're on the cusp between laziness and action, then the message is, ""yeah, taking that step does hurt, but you'll be ok. It's a learning experience, and admitting you can do things, and then doing them, isn't going to kill you.""

And if you've read this and are just nodding your head ""yep,"" then you don't even need to read this thread cause you already know that everything will be ok. So now it's your turn to just teach others what you already know, and that's about it.","5_1_1_1"

That's not really advice. Obviously if everyone can do things perfectly, then that's the ideal. Most people won't be able to do that. 

So instead, I'll say this: I've struggled with mental health issues since I was very young (before I became a teenager) and have lived with them for two decades at this point. One of the issues I struggle with most is leaving my house. I've traveled all over the world, but it's never consistent - I'll be okay for a few months and then won't be able to step foot outside for six months. 

What I'm saying is that I know what it's like to live a ""normal"" life, but I also know what it's like to live an incredibly isolated one and I've had decades to sort out living at home. And, maybe more importantly, I know what it's like to suddenly go from living a normal life to being unable to leave my home despite really wanting to (the brain be that way sometimes). It's normal to go through a period of grief where you miss your normal routine, and that's okay. I'd imagine a lot of people are still at that stage right now.

Setting a schedule is a great idea - getting out of bed at a and consistent reasonable time for some coffee or breakfast, whatever that specific time might mean to you and your lifestyle, can make you feel surprisingly more centered. Don't feel up to getting out of bed to make food? That's okay, too. Can you grab something out of the fridge and maybe just sit up in bed and watch YouTube for awhile? Because that's progress when you're struggling to even wake up every day. 

Having a plan for your day, even a loose one, can help make you feel like you're up for a reason even if you're not leaving your house. 

Paying attention to when and what you eat is good, but so is embracing a sense of normalcy. If ordering takeout once and a while helps you with that and you can afford to do it (and tip the courier!), then do it. There's nothing wrong with that. 


Even though you're stuck inside, why not psych yourself up with a movie night? Or a game night, or a ""Halloween in April"" night? Take something you like and make an ordeal out of it. If you have food to spare, cook something you love and spend a few hours *not* worrying about the virus if at all possible. As an example, I full-out decorated my place for Christmas this week and have been planning to have hot chocolate and watch A Christmas Story all day Saturday lol... look for simple things like this, even if they seem silly.

But mostly, listen to yourself and make adjustments as needed. No advice will work for everyone, and it's way more important to focus on self-care and be forgiving than it is to berate yourself for not doing everything you'd normally do if life wasn't disrupted. 

Like, this is a massive and sudden change and that's really hard to handle. As I've mentioned, I have a ton of experience not leaving my house and this situation is difficult for me, too, just because of how different the world outside is right now. It's hard to accept a new and unknown danger. Give yourself some time to adjust and maybe pick out just a couple of things to do consistently every day - coffee at 8AM and a shower at 6PM or something. 

You know yourself best, so be your own advocate and best friend right now. 

Note that all of this pertains to someone with no children lol... I'm sorry, all I have is my cat and she's always been pretty easy to care for. But theoretically, the advice would hold true.

EDIT: Also, I work from home and have for years - I can't emphasize how important having a different part of the house to work in vs relax in can be. You can do this even in a studio apartment. Maybe the kitchen or the wall closest to the kitchen is where you work while your bed is where you chill, etc... any kind of separation, even if it's largely mental, can help you be more productive while working and more relaxed when you're not. And set limits if you can. When I first started working from home, I'd work any and all hours (as a freelance writer). The problem with that is you end up feeling as though work never really ends. If you had specific hours when working from the office, try to keep those at home so that you still have time where you are demonstrably done with work for the day.","7"

In hindsight I can see how my post and comments made it definitely seem that way, and Im sorry for coming off so arrogant. That said, your advice doesnt contradict mine, I think. I think its a complimentary sort of thing. 

My advice by itself can, Ill admit, lead to someone having too much pressure on themselves to be perfect when they cant. Just like I hope you can admit that your advice can lead to someone becoming stagnant if left unchecked as well. Feeling like youre not doing enough, when you are doing more than enough, is just as harmful as feeling youre doing too much, when theres more you can do without much effort but are choosing not to. 

So to satisfy both ends, I think we can agree this is reasonable. When you struggle to get out of bed, then maybe just go grab a quick bite from the fridge and watch TV. But dont let that become habitual on days when you know that you can get out of bed and do more. Otherwise youve let self-care devolve into laziness. But also, dont push yourself to work to exhaustion and depression when youre already at your breaking point. If youre carrying so much weight, feel free to set it down for a while. Just dont be so quick to get back to carrying that weight until youve healed, otherwise your work (or learning, or art, etc.) is sloppy, and worse yet, your mental health will just get worse. 

Does that sound good to us both?","7_1"

I forgot to add that into my original comment, but it was by learning to be constantly genuine which led to me finding my fiancé. And while we both have our own issues, we both realize, because of our genuine outlook on life, that we are better as compliments to each other than separately. Even though we *could* work separately, we function better as a duo who both share in each others struggles and try to fix them. When one of us falls behind, the other tries to lift them up. When we both fall behind, we drift apart for a little bit. But we do find each other again afterward, because our teamwork is better for us at that point. 

I wouldnt have been able to be in this relationship if not for my understanding of this, and neither would she. But we do. So thats why it works. And I wouldnt have understood this unless I learned to be ok with myself, and then let things just happen as they do.","8_1_1"

Best thing to do, for me, has been to find ways to make a small difference in the lives of other people. Right now, my biggest morale-booster is fostering cats. I have an elderly former street cat with kidney disease and bad teeth--he's the sweetest thing you ever saw, but he's a shelter long-timer because of his health problems. Knowing that I'm helping him have a good life is part of what keeps me going, too.

There's volunteer work you can do online. I hang out at Zooniverse sometimes, helping catalogue scientific data. You don't have to be a scientist; they're all simple tasks, like recognizing patterns or identifying things in pictures, that a computer can't do, a human can, and so get crowdsourced. If you like science, try it. I find some projects annoying, others interesting; but there's a lot of variety. I put on an audiobook while I work.

Scientifically, no pandemic lasts forever. It simply doesn't. A pandemic represents an unstable equilibrium between the pathogen and its hosts. The pathogen evolves, the hosts change their protective strategies, the hosts evolve (well, maybe not that last one; human evolution is slow), and the pandemic ends. The most contagious disease in the world--measles--is controlled now. We've basically eradicated polio. We *have* eradicated smallpox. The 1918 flu mutated until it's no more deadly than a regular year's flu. Viruses that used to kill elders with pneumonia are now easily vaccinated against.

Ive seen literally thousands of people get their covid shots.

The people that try and take a long time to feel ready just make themselves more anxious and prolong the experience when they could be in and out in 5 minutes.

One more thing I can recommend is make sure your doctor does a countdown. Say countdown from five and give me the shot at one.

As far as I know, I'm fine.  I don't smoke and I watch what I eat.  

We do walk 5 miles several time/week, which keeps us fit.  I get blood draws every few months and a yearly EKG.  I do take Vitamin D and zinc supplements, which I've read lessens risk of getting COVID.

Sounds like you don't have any underlying symptoms; I suggest getting vaxxed.  

Try and get some rest, drink lots of fluids and maybe take some supplements.

It's going to be far more gradual than we might expect or would like, and probably won't follow what would feel like a natural path. 

On a social level, we've probably already seen its start, but it's hard to recognize. For example, I had to go to the mall the other day, and it was kind of interesting how many people were there, probably like 95% in masks, as required by the state and the mall, but also how much they moved like they did before the pandemic. I didn't see abnormal attempts to keep six feet distance outside of in queues for registers where lines on the floor were marked by pieces of tape. Thinking back to my experiences in the same area at grocery stores back in April and May, it was completely different, I remember people like really making an effort to step out of the way of each other, stay like one person per aisle and it's just not the case anymore seemingly. (I think that a lot of people see the mask as a sort of social contract, with this unstated acceptance that provided you're wearing it you can go about life as normal). The constant mindfulness required in keeping six feet of distance is I think much tougher for people than just wearing the mask is because you don't have to think about it that much, so it's kind of started to falter as of recent at least socially. I don't condone it, but it's happening. I imagine stuff like that is what you'll start to see over the next year as better therapies continue to come out and vaccines become available. It won't be like an after-World War II sort of thing where we go out and have post-COVID parades in the street the day a vaccine gets approved, but there will probably be slow, general attrition. Guidelines will probably have to shift to deal with how behaviour shifts over time. 

It'll be imperfect, especially because a lot of people have adapted to this this zero-risk mindset that's just going to prove infeasible over the next few months. The existence of a vaccine will probably see more people throwing caution to the wind, the expanded availability of one over time will result in more probably. It'll be slow and take time, the removal of mask mandates will probably be pretty quiet, cinemas and concert venues will have pretty minor, small-scale re-openings that gradually become larger over the weeks, sports stadiums are already starting to allow spectators back in (certain MLS teams already have in the US and Canada, certain NFL teams will in the coming weeks, and I genuinely think NASCAR has had fans in the stands all summer) and that's going to grow gradually as well. It's gonna be imperfect and uncomfortable, the first vaccines are probably going to be imperfect as you say, but dominoes will continue to fall and eventually you'll look around and feel yourself living a life you enjoy again.

I liked [this piece on the end of SARS in Hong Kong in the early 2000s](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/when-sars-ended) to show something hopeful for the future. There will be a day when you're doing something, like waiting in line at a concert venue, or commuting to your job, or just seeing someone smile at you from across a room, that you haven't done in a long time, and you might not even recognize it initially. The anticipation for that is reason enough for me to hold on, and I hope it can be for you too.","6"

Eventually there will be a cost-benefit analysis that make more sense to just start opening things up, and I think that will happen when the vaccine is available widespread which would be the end of 2021. The reason Fauci is saying end of 2021 is because the vaccine manufacturers have said that they will only have a few million doses of the vaccine in early 2021, but closer to a billion doses by the end of 2021.  So even though the vaccine will probably be available in the next few months it will be limited only a few individuals which isn't going to do much until the vaccine becomes available for everyone.","9"

If you're not doing it already, encourage your husband to stay in his room, with a window open, and essentially treat this as a hospital ward - he should eat in his room rather than using the kitchen, and you should wear a face covering when you go in. Try to leave a window open when he uses the bathroom and ask him to wipe down surfaces when he leaves. If you're not sharing a room, your chances of secondary transmission are around 1 in 6, so far from guaranteed. 

And, even if you do get it, it sounds as if you're in a low-risk age group and are fit - a runner probably doesn't have any serious underlying health conditions. It sounds as if you're 'doom scrolling' - looking for and reading obsessively 'worst case' outcome stories from the media; serious long-term damage is by far the absolute minority of cases - be aware that when people say 'long covid' or 'covid long haulers' they can mean anything from a linger hoarseness or minor cough for a few weeks. A tiny, tiny minority are experiencing life-changing long-term symptoms at a level that would prevent you from running.

This virus has so many of us terrified of worst-case scenarios (and I'm one of them), but remember that most people recover completely - or don't even know that they were infected at all.  We hear mostly about the ones that don't, and focus on the worst.

First, close the air vents in the whole house. If you can stand the weather as is wherever you are, close alllll of them except the ones in your husbands room. 

Second, if possible, get a couple of air purifiers (contact delivery or services like Instacart. Walmart and many other stores have them like Target, Best Buy), keep one in your room and another either in the kitchen or any other room you spend a lot of time in. Look for the ones that say HEPA grade. 

Finally, act as though you're living on a cruise ship.

\- If you have not been vaccinated yet, do so. There is some evidence that suggests long haulers can get some relief by becoming vaccinated. (I understand it's hard to come by in some states but continue to make it a priority either way)

\- Talk to your doctor about your options about medications to take or any ways for physical relief. I'd suggest bringing up a steroid shot, which is a fast way to get your body back on track after any illness generally. Again, I'm no doctor, so they'll know for sure what the right thing to do is.

\- Talk to your team about how you're feeling. They're your friends and colleagues after all- they may be more understanding than you think. If you need some time off to recover, take it. It'd be better for you to be out for a week and rest than to burn out completely. 

\- Talk to your partner about ways she can help relieve you of some of this burden you are clearly feeling. I'm sure she would be willing to help if you were clear on what you needed from her.

It hurts to hear you in such distress. You remind me a bit of my own partner, who often feels like the weight of the world is on his shoulders too. I emphasize with that struggle. It's hard for the breadwinner to feel like they can have any moment of weakness, but it happens, and you're human. And you're loved by your family and friends! Hang in there and please get some rest my friend.","1"

You are only 2 weeks out of a serious infection. You may get better soon. You may notbut you dont help yourself by adding more anxiety to it. 

Be careful of r/covidlonghaulers . There may be good resources there but keep in mind everyone in that sub is looking for help with their symptoms. The people who recovered are more likely to have moved on.

The best thing you can do right now is focus on resting and talking to your doctor about taking steps to manage and improve your condition. 

You may want to ask if drinking that much caffeine is having adverse affects. Things like a regular sleeping schedule and diet could help too.

It may help to also write to your boss and express these very concerns. If you are senior and needed there, they have no choice but to be understanding of your needs. So do detail your needs as far as work hours, time management, and whether you need to be working from home. Maybe a pillow fort is not out of the question. You shouldnt feel guilty about taking time for your health. 

Your body is constantly healing and finding ways to improve. You will get better sooner or later.

And I also feel so separate from everyone. My husband is my support person through this, and I am grateful I do not live alone and have someone I love that I can laugh and have some fun with. But, being an introvert, I really thrived by just being around others. Not necessarily full on interaction, but just seeing faces, getting my morning coffee on the way to work, sitting near people, hearing chatter throughout the day. We were all part of a bigger world, and it became really small. Lately all my human in in person interactions seem to be poor. I find people are short with me, and I am trying to not take it personally but it is honestly impacting my mental well being, like: why have I been cut out of the world? Getting thoughts like ""what did I do wrong?"". I know I need to try and make the best of things, but it is getting harder, and harder.
I also have colleagues that are on zoom every second it feels like. I just need to not be on zoom for one fucking workday. They also always ask what my plans are for the weekend. Which is getting exhausting. Nothing. I don't drive, I'm not going to take public transit for an hour to see a friend. I do puzzles and watch more Netflix. This is so brutal.","1"

Posts like this, especially when written by younger people, highly concern me.  If you are under the age of 60 and don't have an underlying health condition, the risk to you even if you were to catch the virus is negligible.  The risk to your mental health from the way you are living is FAR greater than the risk Covid poses to you. 

I highly suggest you read this: [https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/) 

Also remember that CFRs are still only estimated and will likely be reduced in future due to the amount of asymptomatic cases which have gone uncounted. 

As for your chances of catching the virus from that interaction: 

I live in the UK which everyone knows has a high number of (confirmed) cases. My workplace did not close during Covid, so I have been working every day since March. I've been sitting on a bus filled with people every day, 2x a day. I only started wearing a mask on public transport around 2 weeks ago as it became required by law. I don't wear a mask at work and I work in a building of 400+ people. I've also interacted with various friends, shop staff, delivery people etc. on multiple occasions not at 6ft distance.  And I haven't caught it yet. If I did, I must have been asymptomatic, like my friend's 87 year old dementia-sufferer grandma in a care home, who tested positive last month and did not experience a single symptom. 

I really hope that at some point you are able to look at this situation more rationally and hopefully be less afraid of the world.  It saddens me what the media has done to people. 

Take care.","7"

I am 32, but my mother in law who is higher risk is living with us. I need to minimize the risk of bringing it home. I have watched the CFR fall. Good news. I suspect it will continue to, even though this isnt always the case with epidemics. I am concerned about sequelae or just having a ream rough go if it. 

The change isnt too jarring. Ive lost the gym, church, and writing from the cafe when I dont have to teach. Im a professor, so I got sent home. Couldnt get into my office if I wanted to. Im new in my city and hadnt made close friends yet. I still exercise a lot, even outside. All this to say, life is noticeably different but it is not over the top. Ive also been in teletherapy to monitor my mental health. 

You are the second person to bring up the media. Early in the pandemic, the US press made fun of people for being afraid of it, compared it to the flu, and predicted it wouldnt leave China. I dropped the mainstream press and curated a list of virologists, epidemiologists, and other sources for preprints and peer-reviewed studies. Im not being frenzied by the media, which I am generally skeptical toward. The science is alarming too.

I've definitely formed some sort of anxiety I've never had before and sometimes I struggle with the thought I won't be as personable or relaxed as I used to be.. but as soon as I got fully vaccinated my mindset started coming back to normal. I just went to my first outting at a local dj show and had a great time. Then went on a bar crawl a few days later. If anything, people are more personable and open than they used to be.

A big issue is the way we've grown to see covid in the last 20 months. The first year it was seen very rightly as a huge threat to life and an unknown enemy and things felt very different. But while covid of late 2021 is now no longer the same beast of the early days (thanks to milder variants and better protections) many people still haven't changed their mindset and stil have the idea that catching it is a death sentence despite being triple vaxxed. But its really not that anymore.

I think your best bet is finding a new interest or hobby, taking a class, or working longer hours at your job if you have one. I play chess daily and it DOES help, even if its only for a short time.

* *People (kids and teenagers without their own phone line mostly, but maybe college age too) knocking on your door unannounced to do something:* To a lot of young people, they would think this is horribly intrusive and disrupting to any plans they may have. In reality, if you didnt call ahead, the person opening the door had every right to say, Sorry, Im busy/going out right now/have homework/need to mop the floor. That wasnt considered rude for a drop in (with no call or plans made); the philosophy was easy come, easy go.

* The same went for phone calls too: you pick up the phone and its your brother/friend/whoever. Got time to chat? Great! In the middle of something? Just tell them so and say youll call back. Doing something in another room? Just hang up the phone, waltz over, and pick it up there within about 30 seconds, as long as they dont hang up their end of the line (a feature of landlines that people rarely use nowadays).

* Similarly, there was less pressure for hanging out to be a purely fun or exciting activity, for kids and adults. My mom (who was pretty firmly in grown up territory, having a son, house, and husband) once chatted up a neighbor that she knew, but not very well.

The tough thing about depression is that it really does feel like it'll never get better, but that isn't true. It's a long time, I won't lie. I struggle with that a lot, too, because it feels like it won't end. But that's just our brains freaking out on us. It will get better - it always does.

Please reach out for some therapy. Even though it doesn't seem like it'll help right now, give it a try. They might recommend meds (which can be extremely helpful) or they may just help you talk and process. Either way, it's your first step. 

It also sounds like you do marginally better when you have something to look forward to. Are there other things you can plan or do to look forward to? I find that even minor things have been super helpful for me. Something like making a special dinner, planning a specific movie night, or buying myself a game or book I'm interested in. They're small, but if you can plan something once a week or once every couple of weeks, it gives you something. 

I'd also say reaching out to your friends would be great - they may be struggling too and not know how to reach out. Even if that isn't the case, let someone know that you just need someone to be there. It's okay to need something from your friends, even if it's not reciprocated. That's what friends are for and you'll be there for them when they need you, too.

Lastly, is there any way you can move out (assuming you think living alone/with roommates would be more helpful for your mental health)? Even if it means taking more loans or putting yourself at a financial disadvantage, if it helps you should do it. Nothing is more important than your mental health right now. Please reach out!","2"

When I was 19 I developed extreme anxiety and I went through ***HELL***. At some point I felt so bad that I just couldn't talk properly, think straight, read, watch a movie. I lost my first year of college and basically spent a good 6 months in bed shaking. I was so sure that it had to be permanent because there was no way I could recover from that. I even forced my doctor to order a brain MRI because I was convinced I had a gigantic brain tumor that was blocking my brain from functioning (spoiler: there was nothing wrong with my brain). I didn't feel anything. No feelings. No joy, no sadness. Just pain and anxiety when I was lucky, absolutely nothing when I was unlucky. 

And then I asked for help. It wasn't straightforward as you see in movies. It took me almost a year to get back on my feet completely, but I spent a fair amount of time being halfway 'normal' and I really didn't mind because anything was better than hell. And then one day I just woke up and realized I was fine. It was a process of healing. 

Now, clearly your situation is different. There is something objective that is bothering you, but there is a good chance that once that is out of the way (hopefully soon) your mind will start to heal. And if you still feel like this you can ask for help. Therapy is an amazing tool. But trust me when I tell you that nothing is permanent, ESPECIALLY a state of mind.","3"

For exercise if running is out of the question because of the weather maybe check out some quality clothing to keep you going until snow.

I did cut ties with someone during all this, although for a very different reason. He was completely uncaring about my partner's (likely) imminent job loss. Almost to the point of rubbing it in our faces because he thought it was so important for the industry to be completely shut down. I also have other friends that I don't agree with, but to a lesser and less personal extent. For now, I'm doing my best to get past that and think we'll probably still be friends in the future.

That being said, if it's *all* of your friends, there may be something here that you're missing. That's not to say that you need to agree or approve of what they're doing, but if they're all doing things and you (presumably) thought they were decent people before this year, it probably means there's more to it. For example, you don't mention any particular struggles with staying home. Maybe you did have them and didn't say, but a lot of people are struggling to the point of being suicidal.

So maybe the best case scenario is asking our friends ""why did you do these things?"" and they ultimately have solutions that make it easier to accept their decisions.

They may also be unwilling or unable to articulate the ways they've been struggling - I've noticed that seems to be especially common among people who haven't struggled with mental health prior to this. It's hard to put it all into the right words, especially when you're hearing that you're just selfish for doing what you're doing (this often ends up feeling like being told you're selfish for struggling, which of course is not at all helpful). 

Whatever you decide, I hope it works out well for you and your friends.","3_1_1"

\- Knowing that I'm not perfect - I'm doing my best with the tools that I have.

\- Believing that others are too. Not everyone reads and listens to the same things I do, has the same job or relationship or opportunities that I do, copes with things in the same way I do. This pandemic is *hard*, and everyone is struggling to various degrees. That one barhopping friend could be struggling with job issues, food insecurity, relationship issues, domestic violence, depression, family stress behind the scenes. Humans were built for connection, and it's *hard* to go for months on end without it.

\- Knowing that the precautions I take do help **me**, in addition to others. It's not entirely selfless and I'm making the choices I make for me. If I can avoid it, I don't want to get this, at all. I also don't want to live with the guilt of spreading this to someone. What anyone else decides has no bearing on what I am doing.

\- Also, as to some friends and family who have wanted to get out there, or didn't believe it was real, or whatever - a lot of them actually got it and went through a rough time.

So, I do hope to reconnect with some friends and family when it is safe to. I believe we are all just doing our best to get through.","4"

the good things are that:

- this is a relatively small community and i see the same people at these practice parties (i've been at 4 so far), so it kinda counts as a social bubble, i guess????? 

- the room is big enough to keep the distance, especially when you're playing the set, also, the party is in two separate rooms (and one of them has way better ventilation) which means that the crowd kinda evenly distributes between two stages or smth like that

- i don't really go there to socialize, i play my set and usually i go first bc sleep schedule and taxi prices, and leave almost immediately, so i stay there for 1 hour tops

and speaking of buses, well, my town has a shitty public transit system, especially in remote areas. not too many buses which is why they are not crowded only during weekends at specific times of the day. i've had a fear of crowds long before the pandemic and i've always been uncomfortable in crowded buses. but with the pandemic, i just can't. mostly i just feel exhausted, anxious, and irritated even after 10-minute bus rides, worst case scenario is a full-blown meltdown that could last another hour after i leave the bus lol. i even filed a complaint to the local administration because each year public transit gets worse but nothing really changed.","1_1"

- mask mandates in public spaces (obviously) but it's poorly controlled tbh

- QR-codes that show you're fully vaccinated, recovered from covid, or had a negative PCR not older than 72 hours (since november 2021) for all public spaces but supermarkets, public transport, hospitals, and drugstores, currently the local government consider QR-codes for everything

- curfew for clubs, concert venues, bars, and other entertainment services (events after 11 pm are forbidden), i've always been lowkey pissed at this rule because you guys know that the virus is not mafia or something, it doesn't wake up after the sunset

German Ministry of Health recommends to get tested if you had contact to an infected person (or if you have symptoms or have been to a risk area - [https://www.morgenpost.de/vermischtes/article230426344/Corona-Virus-Test-Wann-muss-man-ihn-machen.html](https://www.morgenpost.de/vermischtes/article230426344/Corona-Virus-Test-Wann-muss-man-ihn-machen.html) (in German)). There are somewhat different recommendations by RKI to test contact persons if they have symptoms, even if the symptoms are slight ( [https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges\_Coronavirus/Teststrategie/Testkriterien\_Herbst\_Winter.html;jsessionid=DAE0F458754ADA5CFB99FB7BE6FDA7E2.internet091?nn=2386228#doc15004192bodyText3](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Teststrategie/Testkriterien_Herbst_Winter.html;jsessionid=DAE0F458754ADA5CFB99FB7BE6FDA7E2.internet091?nn=2386228#doc15004192bodyText3) \- in German). Test criteria may be different where you live and could change.

As the contact has been for a longer time and shortly before the onset of symptoms the risk seems to be increased. Approximately half of Covid-19 infections occur presymptomatically or asymptomatically. On the other hand young children are less likely to fall ill. I would suggest to contact a doctor by phone and discuss if and when you should be tested (do not go there in person without having discussed the situation in advance). 

And as far as feasible follow hygiene and distance rules within your family and ventilate rooms often. Even if one of you is infected this does not mean all of you will get it.

Good luck!","2"

Also, take the time to save, and save hard. Is there anything your boyfriend can do to improve his credit rating? If there's a specific issue, such as his credit card debt is too high, use the time you can't go out as a chance to pay these off and get back on track.

You Said it perfectly. I understand you both so well.. I have been on edge because I don't think my roomates are taking care (e.g. they are having someone over this evening, they randomy decide to go to IKEA, they have to go to their office once or twice per week and they don't seem bothered by it.. etc.); I have an important medical thing coming up and if I get sick it will have to be postponed till who knows when, I have hoped for some understanding and despite them saying that they would stop until it happened.. well it hasn't.   


I have locked myself up in my room and I am avoiding being on the spaces that need to be shared (kitchen, living room) at the same time; I'm pretty sure that I am the bad one now.. but I really do not want to get sick and I truthfully feel like I am safer by just being isolated.  


I truthfully can only suggest the same.. keep to yourselves as much as possible. Use your own cuttlery, use your own water bottle, ventilate rooms before using them and avoid sharing spaces. Wear a mask outside of your room too if necessary.","2_1_1_1"

The reason is to slow the spread from people with few to no symptoms (yet) who don't realize that they have COVID-19. Even if many people get this disease in the end, we can reduce the strain on our hospitals by spreading out the length of time when people get sick - so the 20% with serious illness get the best care possible.

I feel so deeply touched by your post that I could not help but to reach out to you.

You are hurting, but you are very strong. And by engaging us all into this very delicate and heart-breaking situation for you and your family, you have shown a really strong survival instinct.

This is an ultimate decision with no right or wrong answer. I took care of my mother at home for years with a very sick heart. she had a DNR. Even then, I could not believe how inconsolable I was when she passed away.

Did you consider a third option? You could ask the hospital and the attending physician to keep your brother on the ventilator for the length of time that they believe that he will survive. And ask them to allow you and your family to keep a video vigil on him, even if you have to take turn. During that time you could talk to him, and tell him how you feel and how things are going with the family. You could pray with him, if you are religious. That would be one way to be with him until the end, or to see him pull through, even if that is considered a remote possibility.

You know, my husband was put in an induced coma for 10 days after he did not wake up one morning from a walking pneumonia. He went septic, was put on a ventilator, and went into organ failure. Doctors would not give me any hopeful words that he would come out of the ICU alive, and if so what his condition would be. I continued to go to the hospital every day and talk to him, and touch him. I know that you cannot be there with your brother. But my husband woke up from his coma, and he told me later that he could hear some things while he was sedated.

Do your best to keep in touch with your brother by phone. Find nurses and doctors who will hold the phone to him. Tell them what you are trying to do, and what you want for your brother. You will find people there who will understand and try to help you, if not that particular doctor. Hopefully, your brother will survive that doctor's tour.","2_1_1"

BOSTON  The new coronavirus made Dr. Jag Singh a patient at his own hospital.

Singh became alarmed when he saw an X-ray of his pneumonia-choked lungs and colleagues asked about his wishes about life support as they wheeled him into the intensive care unit at Massachusetts General Hospital.

So when they offered Singh, a heart specialist a chance to help test **remdesivir,** an experimental drug that's shown promise against some other coronaviruses, ""it did not even cross my mind once to say 'No,' "" he said.

You are so very young!  But here you are, in a life struggle, and fighting for your brother and your mom. You will come out of this stronger and wiser.

They took your brother's phone because if it rings he will not be able to pick it up. The hospital knows that he can still hear sounds and voices. Although it may not be clear to what extent. And there is no way to know how he will react to the ring of the phone, because people who are in an induced coma can react to external stimuli, such as sound and voices. Think of it this way. Your brother is not dead. He is just very sick and sedated.

Make arrangement with the staff so you can call at a certain time when someone can hold the phone to him. Talk to your brother. Tell him that you are fighting for him. Tell him how much you miss him, and how the family looks to him to recover. He needs to know that he can fight, and that he does have a lot of fight left him. Tell him that you are worried about him. Tell him everything that you are doing to protect him. Tell him that the rest of the family is thinking about him and is waiting for him to get better. His will to live is still intact. That is why he is still alive, though very sick.

Ask the hospital for updates on his condition: Is his viral load going down? Is there any organ damage? What they are doing for him as far as treatment? Whether they are trying any of the experimental drugs? Are they treating him with a blanket family of antibiotics? There are antibiotics that cover everything. They usually use those for pneumonia of unknown etiology. Ask what kind of anti-viral treatment he is getting? Ask about respiratory therapy? Ask whether or not he is being re-positioned? Ask whether or not they have lowered the dose of his sedation level to see how his body reacts?

Make sure to take care of yourself. Make sure to eat and sleep well, and get some rest. Take deep breaths and do some exercise during the day, however minimal. Share these thoughts with your mom, and ask someone else to help you with talking to the hospital and talking with your brother. And remember that you are not alone, and that there are millions of people out there in your brother's position, and millions more, just like you, who are gong through high level of anxiety. And millions more who are yet dealing with all kinds of trouble and complications due to this global pandemic, which has turned into an epidemic here in this country, none of which any of us could have prevented.

You do not have to be religious to know intuitively that there is a grand design in our universe. Live by ancient knowledge and wisdom:

A lot of the questions you posted are questions I've been asking everyday. He hasn't made a lot of progress but the doctor called me again today and told me that he was basically tanking and probably not going to make it (again) and may only be around for a few days. I don't understand the change in his status because only an hour before I got that doctor's call I had called the nurse to check in on him and she said he was stable and doing fine and then when the doctor called me he told me that he was having a lot of blood in his lungs, his labs were everywhere, the antibiotics for his ventilator were not working, and that we really need to consider the 2 options that were discussed before. I'm so furious today, I couldn't even cry.","2_1_1_2_2_1"

One minute they are telling you that he is stable, the next minute he is critical, depending on who is doing the talking. That is unacceptable.

A couple of things: Those people cannot force you to make any decision that you do not want to make, or feel comfortable making; Also, they had told you 2 - 3 days, and now they are telling you ""a few days,"" plus ""probably."" I am sure that they are overwhelmed. But they are still responsible for taking proper care of each patient and working with the family in a close, caring, and cooperative manner.

Tell them that you want your brother to receive the full range of treatment and care available, and that you also want him to be a ""full code,"" meaning that you want everything done until everything has been exhausted. 

Call on every shift and ask to speak with someone. Ask whether or not he was stable earlier. Ask to speak with the shift supervisor. Ask them to call you. I think that the doctor you have been speaking with is the hospitalist or the attending intensive care doctor. Ask for a call from the infectious disease specialist, the lung specialist, and the neurologist who are treating your brother. Let us see if in fact he has been seen by various specialists before they decide how much time he has to live. Let us see what kind of care he is getting.

Ask for his vital signs. Ask them if they have used the range of antibiotics and anti-viral medicines, and what specifically he is getting. Ask the nurses whether or not he has responded to any stimulus or neurological consult. Ask them if they know whether or not he feels pain, and if they have attempted to get any response from him. 

Have you been able to get them to hold the phone to your brother's ear so that you can speak to him? If they do that, he could be stimulated and respond by making some noise. That can happen.

Why do they keep telling you that he is not going to make it? That is very curious! Doctors and hospitals are not supposed to insist on things like that. This is a cynical thing for me to wonder. But are they short on ventilators? Space? What? Something is not right. 

You do not have to choose between two options. Those are the doctor's option, not yours, and certainly not your brother's. Sit down. Take a deep breath. Manifest in your mind what you want to happen next.

Do not be afraid. Tell the doctor and nurses there that you choose to see your brother pull through or give up on his own time. And that you do not intend to let anyone make that decision for him, not you and certainly not them.

Take it easy so you can find the strength to fight harder. You are not alone. I am thinking of you and your mom. Let me know what happens.","2_1_1_2_2_1_1"

Im not going to tell you what I would do, but these are the questions that I would ask myself if I were in your position.

Do I trust the current doctors judgement? Does my reading of the labs support the doctors prognosis? When is the doctor's floor shift over? Id ask myself this one due to personal experience. When I was sick my caregivers had some rounds docs who were excellent and some who were not. For example, the week I was in renal failure the rounding doctor was an anesthesiologist and told my mother that Id be dead in a day. My nephrologist came by to check in and told him he was full of shit. She was right, he was wrong. 

Maybe more important than those more practical questions above are the more ethical ones that follow: what will it feel like for him if hes woken up? Will it hurt? Will he be scared? Will he understand what is going on? Is saying good bye about the living members of your family or about him? What would he choose? Whatever decision you make Im sure that he knows that it will come from love.","4"

we're trying our best... It's hard for me to comfort my mom since I live in another state but I'll be going home on Saturday this week to see her. we have to keep our distance though since she was tested positive and I don't want to also get sick. But I still want to be close enough in case anything happens. I have a great worry. I think his doctors are on a 3 day rotation at the moment. I want to file a patient advocacy complaint, his bedside manner and things he explains to me just don't seem to match up with what his nurse told me and I feel very concerned. I wish there was a doctor who was watching him from start to finish but this is his 4th doctor so it's hard to say.","4_1_2_1"

I am so sorrry for your family. There is no right or wrong choice here. But I think you have to think whay is best for HIM and not for your family.

This is just my opinion. I would choose option 1. 

Firstly I would rather have my loved one walk into the light in as much peace as possible. To wake him up just to say good-bye, if I was your brother I would find that traumatic. 

Secondly, it is the only chance he has. 

Thirdly, and the one that speaks the loudest in my mind-  if he is that sick, if the sedation is reversed would he even be aware enough to say goodbye? He would be so hypoxic and it sounds like a lot of damage has likely been done. And my experience with hypoxic patients who are somewhat aware is usually being grabbed onto with a death grip and/or they are delusional from lack of oxygen to the brain. 

I hope you are able to find some peace with whatever decision you amd your family decide to make.","5"

I feel as though waking him up to say good bye would be so traumatic. i feel like that would be a horrible memory for us and for him if there is an afterlife... if I were in his position I really don't think I would want to wake up. a peaceful sleep sounds good I just hope he isn't in pain while they have him sedated.

I'm not going to suggest which of the two paths you ought to take because I feel it is so personal of a decision it would be wrong for me to do that.  However, there's something I wanted to point out, that from what I can see of this thread, it doesn't seem yet to have been considered.

If your mom video calls to his bedside to say goodbye whilst he remains sedated, she will find it traumatic, but she will see him calm and at a degree of peace.

If your mom video calls to his bedside to say goodbye after sedation is lifted; well - you have no idea of the level of difficulty and/or distress your brother will be in (not just emotionally at the realization he is about to die; I also mean the physical struggles of altered lucidity, of gasping for breath, of physical pain/distress).  That is potentially something your mom will never be able to un-see, and potentially something that will haunt her the rest of her life, over and above the traumas of knowing your child is to die.

I hope bringing this perspective up with you helps you in your decision.

I'm not a medical doctor, and don't claim to know more than professionals, but I imagine it's difficult for them to keep up with the all the new research into this virus.

Wait this guy out if you can and see what the next doctor says.  Even if it's the exact same thing we can hope they will deliver it with more empathy.

It's your current reality but it will become the most important story in your life for years to come - weather he passes or miraculously improves - and somehow this choice you've been presented with feels like a forced end.

i have experienced the long drawn out death of my mother (cancer, years ago). my father volunteers with hospice and currently has do-not-resuscitate messages prominently posted (he's in his 70s with existing lung damage; thankfully no symptoms).

i see hope that your brother will get better but no indications of improvement. i'm going to take the position here that he won't get better. this is of course the worse thing to say and discuss -- particularly with an internet stranger and where nuance and concern have a hard time coming through. the best i can do here is acknowledge this is a shitty time and place and a horrible thing to have happen. I'm sorry.

For myself in that position I'd rather be able to say my goodbyes. For myself in that condition I'd rather pass on the resources, attention, and if equipment is needed the ventilators to somebody else who needs them. This probably does almost nothing to help you in your decision. Its just a perspective.

I think what destroys me thinking about this question is that you'll wake him up and tell him what you decided. What if he disagrees!? How do you 'say goodbye' like that? I think the answer is with honesty and love and tears. If you decide to take that path - i hope and imagine that he'll understand and spend the time, however limited by video screens and technology, to share a moment and share warm thoughts and memories with you.

Be well. Stay safe. Do not let anybody tell you what the right choice is; but when you do make one please don't second guess yourself. You only have a moment in time and limited options and no way of knowing the future. The choice you make will be the one you \_could\_ make -- and anything else is just people who weren't in your position doing back-seat-driving.  Ignore them, and me, we know nothing.","15"

It's ultimately your decision, but I would ask the doctors to make a call where you all can tell him how much you love him.

I lost my sister 5 yrs ago. She was on life support for about 10 days while we gathered family and continued doing testing to see if she had any chance. We ended up being forced by the courts to remove her from the life support because she suffered brain death. I had my wallet with everything in it stolen from the waiting room at the hospital. Stuck in a strange town really far from home. It really felt like everything was just going wrong. My family started fighting. It was a shit show.

I am so so sorry that this is happening to you and your family. My mother passed away from stage 4 ovarian cancer back in 2014, she got diagnosed and obviously, she knew there's no coming back from stage 4 cancer, and decided to forgo chemo and other treatments because she didn't want to go through all the suffering it would cause her for a chance to maybe live a few more months. It gutted me to hear her say she didn't want to try to live longer, of course it did, because she was my mom and any chance I had to spend a little more time with her was worth fighting for, but in the end, it was her choice to make, and only hers. 

They gave her 4-6 months to live, but she passed away after a little over 4 weeks. She died peacefully at home, two days after slipping into a coma. 

  
In these kinds of situations, it can be hard for us to figure out what to do, how to act, what to think and feel... I say this, despite how strange it must sound to anyone who hasn't gone through something similar, but we were lucky that she got to choose how she wanted to deal with her battle. It hurt, but she knew what was best for her.  

  
The situation you are in has got to be so much harder because your brother can't make that choice and it's fallen to you to make it for him. I would not wish that burden to be put on anyone. Times are so chaotic now, there are so many people dying that it adds yet another layer to the complicated moral obstacle course that is a situation like yours. Yes, he may pass away even being intubated. But there is a chance that he might not. He may recover. And if it were me, I would fight half the world for even a tiny chance that a loved one would recover. I wouldn't be able to throw that tiny percentage out the window. But we can be selfish creatures when it comes to things like this and in the end, it boils down to what would your brother want? Would he want to keep fighting or would he want to give up? Do what your heart says he would do.   


Again, I am so sorry you are facing this massive task, I hope to the gods your brother will recover, and your mother as well.","25"

My cousin, who had a serious underlying health condition, had to be intubated last fall while she was waiting to get an organ transplant. 

She eventually got to a point where her doctors said she had no hope of recovery. The best they could do for her was keep her comfortable.

Her husband decided to have her taken off of everything that was keeping her alive and let her go. He was able to be there with her and hold her when this happened. 

I was in a different state, but got to speak to her on the phone shortly before she died. She wasnt really there though because she was on drugs to keep her comfortable. 

I felt shocked and unprepared when I got the call so I could goodbye to her. I tried my best to tell her how much I loved her and how much she meant to me and what a bright light she was in my life. I dont remember the specifics of what I said. I remember feeling like it was inadequate. 

Then the medical staff started taking her off life support. They took her off of the ventilator last. She breathed on her own for about 15 minutes. Her breaths got further and further apart. And then they stopped.

She died peacefully. She didnt suffer at the end. Im grateful for that.

We dont know if she knew she was dying. She never really regained full consciousness. After she was intubated she moved her eyebrows some when people talked to her, which the doctors said was voluntary movement. But that was it.

I was devastated by her death. I felt out of control with grief.

**Your situation**

I dont have an opinion on what you should decide for your brother. Hes lucky to have you taking on this weight like you are and being there for him. If he could see what was happening he would youre doing your best for him. He would tell you how grateful he is he could. 

I would ask for the opportunity for people who love your brother like you, his bf, and your mom to be able to talk to him on the phone regardless of whether you wake him up. Your mom can still speak to him even if he stays sedated. He might be able to hear you and be comforted by that. And it will be meaningful for all of you to have done that.

I might ask the doctor what can be done to make your brother as physically comfortable as possible. I dont know whether thats being intubated and on the ventilator or extubated and off the ventilator. If they wake him up will he still be intubated? My understanding is that being intubated is very unpleasant.

Even if your brother recovers, youre going through a traumatic experience. Let yourself be sad and find some way to process your feelings. I wrote down stories of childhood adventures with my cousin and made playlists of songs for her and about her.
 
Im praying for you and your family, and most of all for your brother to pull through.","28"

One thing I find helpful is learning mindfulness/meditation as it allows you to be aware of the transient nature of thoughts and feelings. When I notice I'm feeling depersonalized or anything potentially scary it is now easier to ""ride the waves"" in my mind knowing that I don't need to identify with the feeling and cling to or fight it. 

Of course this isn't a one size fits all so if mindfulness seems to make things worse for anyone don't feel the need to push it. Just one possible tool. Exercise and cold showers are also great as a physical shock can sometimes ""snap"" you back into feeling connected to your body/self in my experience.","3_2"

I usually experience anxiety as a churning in my gut. As I've gotten used to the working from home, and the drumbeat of the news, that feeling has gone away. 

But sometimes I feel like I'm in a Twilight Zone episode, and I'm avoiding thinking about the older people I know because thoughts of them dying hurt way too much (I had an older partner of mine die two years ago, and I still feel aftershocks of that trauma, that sometimes resonate with what's going on now).

Sometimes, the sound of traffic going by my house (on the other side of a cement wall, where I can't see it) sounds to me almost hyper-normal, like ""why are you still out there? The world has changed!!"" and sometimes it's a comforting sound, like ""ok, things can't be that bad if people are still out there"".

I feel a strong urge to go out into the forest, and I wanted to go camping, but now everything is closing; the trails and campsites, the rec areas, even in the national forests, and when I heard that I felt a little bit of panic - I have a yard and a neighborhood, but why can't I go to the forest where nobody's around, and find solace in the trees and animals and rivers?

Well said. IMHO the generation growing up through this - the 'zoomers' - may soon be called The Resilient.

/u/ludakris yes you had a new car to look forward to, is there something else that could get you excited and motivated toward something that isn't going to give you a massive financial crunch? Heck if your additional car payment was going to be another $500/mo (for example) go ahead and spend $2K on one of those 'race day' experiences on a racetrack, driving or training in a supercar.

You've made your desires very clear - for a relationship (for the record I was single until well into my 30's), for a burgeoning career, for a PhD (not a task for the faint of heart), and to be in a place of your own. All desirable things, and completely valid, and all messed up thanks to a number of reasons that we're in a worldwide pandemic.

I stare at the unread pile of books, the 7 lbs I've gained (okay it's have of the Quarantine 15 but still), and my own financial pressures, and know that 'this too shall pass'.  

I'd encourage you to go for the Ph.D., OP. I told my college-age daughter the other day, how when after going into teaching as a career it was in my late 20's I was toying with the idea of a graduate degree plus a career and geography change, and my dear mom encouraged me to go for it. ""No one can ever take that accomplishment of additional schooling away from you."" 

And a few days later, the vice principal of curriculum (who later became principal) said 'I'm going to hate myself for saying this, we'd hate to lose you, but you are single and still young, and next thing you know you'll be married with kids and will have no chance to do what you are thinking of doing. So do it while you can.""

It will be four (or more depending on the field) years of grueling work, focused on a super-narrow topic, earning very little money (but depending on the program can be surprisingly not expensive like undergraduate tuition), while you become a world-expert on a specialty. I can say those years were a ton of super-hard work and very, very rewarding.","2_2"

Having this dilemma with computer equipment. Building and improving my PC will be a good hobby to pass the time, but the components cost so much and my unemployment benefits just ran out (it was a claim from last year that had an extension due to the pandemic --- ironically one that ran out BEFORE the end of July deadline).

I have enough saved to pay bills until (if all goes well) the middle of next year --- but that's only if I only spend money on bills --- which, as unrealistic as that sounds, is still a privilege I know many don't have. But it's not enough to pay bills AND make frivolous purchases. I'm cutting nearly all unnecessary purchases out and making good with what I currently have (non-essential-purchase wise) until I can return to work on a steady and livable wage.

The way I see it, it *is* important to be aware of the risks. But the news sensationalizes the cases that are extraordinary outliers and gets everybody in a panic over those and acts like those situations are the only outcomes if you get covid. Fear sells and is more interesting to watch, good outcomes are not. 

This isnt to say some dont have those awful outcomes, they do and it is truly terrible, but that is not typical in the least, especially if youre under 60 and healthy. Its like a plane crash, does it happen and kill people? Yes. Could it happen to you? Yes. But it is highly unlikely because planes are typically very safe, yet the news only reports the crashes and incidents and not the millions of successful safe flights every year. Perspective is important and can help calm nerves so much.

And I say this as someone who not only takes all the precautions himself, but is also obese (a COVID risk-factor), though I've lost 45ish pounds since January and am only 27.

I'm at higher risk than someone at normal weight for sure, but if weight alone (specifically at my age) really raises my risk of dying from 0.2% to 469% as some discussions make it seem like, then maybe COVID really is an extinction event that has the potential to affect everyone healthy or not, and we should be quarantining ourselves Last-of-Us style. Or maybe 'obesity = auto COVID death sentence' statements like these are severe hyperbole, and given the data we have now, I think I'll go with this.

Went off a slight tangent there, though it just serves to reinforce what you said: we should be cautious, but not fearful, especially since stress is bad for the immune system.","2_1_1"

My story:
might as well add it.
I am not tested at all, for covid.
Astma/bronchitis throughout childhood.
had contact with neurological agents.
Many medicine over the yearas. Daily, 24/7 pain in neck and head.
astma is very mild since years.

wife works in a daycare. 2 kids tested positive, 1 week inbetween. She took care of those 2 for many hours, touching and such.

Its possible i got covid from my wife.
i would like some diagnistic help please.
Since 5 days:
1. Started with sudden, severe nausia. Which i havent been for a decade at least. 5vdays later, still getting acid in the throat when lying down.
2. pain everywhere, like the flue can give. Every muscle, super aches. Under the feet, even! Also 5 days, not getting worse or less.
3. Super tired. Can sleep/lie down awake, time flies. No primal need to get up and take action. 5 daysnot improving,
4. light green, thick mucus frolungsm, though very sporadic. Like 1 cm a day. Not much.
5. Burning mouth, whole day &amp; night, constantly.
6. Temperature. Steady 37.Celcius. all days.
7.Sudden comback, and heavier then ever, of herpes in the mouth corner and even the chin. 4 days now. 
Laste time was 15 years ago, with very small outbreaks for 5 times inbetween, during those 15 years.
Usually when sunburned. Now its terrifying, and glad i can hide it behind a mask.
8. Not vitamine/mineral deficient (checked and regulated by doctor), due to compensation. Was lacking in D for many years. Apperently not making much of it myselve/or problems with uptake in the blood.
9. Loss of focus/concentration. Time ""goes faster"".
 Multitasking leads too often to errors. Corrections often too late. 5 dsys. Started immediatly.
10. Feeling of pressure inward, in the head.
11. Dry skin. Flakes even, on the head.
12 weakend motivation.
13. Had diarrea, like water. Liters. Anti diarrea helps, so dont know if its there if i would stop taking those.
14. took paracetamol, and ibuprofin, for 2 days. No dufference whatsover.
In usual flu, the paracetamol (sry i forgot the usa generic name), is excellent at reducing muscle pain and flue like symptoms. 
This time, no effect. And really avoid taking those. Last time has been 2 years ago, for some days.
So the paracetamol should work fine.
weird it does 0.

Does this sound like covid?","18"

All the more reason to delete social media!! My god all the humblebrags and personal brand building. I just cant, even in normal times.  I love my classmates, but I love them more when I cant see their insta posts :)

Early on, when I was 24, I told a friend that I couldn't live in my parents house as an adult, that I would be too embarrassed. She just said ""But it's not just their house, it's your family home. You are their family, so it's your home too, why would you be embarrassed?"" Since then, I've stayed with my parents temporarily 3 times (when I first moved back to the US, when I broke up with my ex-fiance, and at the start of the pandemic) and each time it's saved me thousands of dollars. Could I have done it on my own? Sure, but it would've cost me so much. My generation is struggling to accumulate any kind of actual wealth, and I can't help but think that it has a lot to do with the fact that we inherited a lot of boomer attitudes about self-reliance, but for us to pay our way through college and live independently, the costs were far higher than they were for boomers. It is insane for us to follow the same rules when the whole game has changed.","5"

Yes. Im going in the same direction albeit, a different boat? I think theres a whole generation of us who are thinking that way and its not just people from one generation. Boomers/Xers/Millenials and Zoomers alike. My wife and I have worked really hard and I feel the same way. I believe she does as well.  

What the American Dream (if it still exists?) fails to account for is unforeseen circumstances. I have to believe, wealth or sense of independence comes initially with luck. Meeting the right person at the right time. Landing the right job and what not. This story goes on. Its just being open to those possibilities that prepares you. Youre doing what you need to do and controlling what you have control over at the moment. You continuing to learn new things, is preparing you for that one person or group that will be your future community and network. If you ever have thoughts of isolation, theres at least a million people feeling like you right now with the Pandemic going on. I hope that brings some sort of comfort to your feelings of isolation and failure if any.

I feel you on everything you just said. I was laid off in July, so I've spent the last 6 months alone in my apartment. As much as I try to convince myself how cute my apartment is... it literally makes no sense. I've been struggling mentally. I'm burning money on rent and have no reason to be here (no job or social life nearby). My schedule is non-existent and I've watched my health decline to the point where... I don't feel like myself anymore. I need to be around people (ENFP here). Moving home has a lot of obvious pros/cons, but recognizing the value of time with your parents (as annoying as they can be) is a blessing. It's practical, saves money, helps family, and the near future is completely unpredictable! I'm also viewing moving home as a ""freeing"" move, helping set a launchpad for whatever IS next.

Although moving home is going to be a big adjustment, I'm grateful I have that option and MY GUT IS TELLING ME IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

Really, the problem is the total lack of anything else in person occurring. I don't have a life, full stop. I live with my parents in my late twenties and essentially haven't been a social being for years on end.

I do and I work better and am happier with it. Its the only new normal thing that is being pushed that I like - I dislike all others. However I don't think it should be permanent for those who prefer being at the office. Even as this pandemic life has had me depressed and struggling mentally, absolutely none of that has been down due to WFH so I guess I am different to you on that. 

For me biggest reasons why I would prefer WFH even beyond all of this: the lack of commute, and also I never really liked socializing with coworkers anyway. 

Lack of commute allows me better and longer sleep, dont have to wake up at 5:30 or 6:00 anymore to go on your 0:45 min drive. Never been a morning person, and that extra 1.5 or 2 hours of sleep would do me really nicely. 

As far as socializing with coworkers, never liked it. Shit is too fake for me, always forced to come up with conversations and also while having to watch what you say. Im not an introvert, anti-social hermit or whatever at all and love socializing (don't know why some like equating not socializing with coworkers with being anti-social and introverted lol) - I just have plenty of friends I actually do like to socialize with and thus I dont have to rely on coworkers to have a social life. Im one of those out on the clock at 5:00 so I can actually spend time with friends and socialize with them. Trying to socialize with coworkers has always been a chore for me and not something I really have time for. Besides, unlike with my friends, I usually have nothing in common with coworkers save for working for the same place, so I don't bother. 

So yeah Id be down for more WFH, though I realize its just me.","7"

As long as I sit in front of a screen every day and do the nonsense some stranger overseas wants, then I get to keep eating.

Unless you truly are a self-driven person (many people think they are, and many people are wrong) who works primarily in an individual contributor role, you aren't as productive at home as you are in the office. At home we are distracted, less likely to be working as diligently, and far more likely to have communication mixups that take extra time to resolve. 

At the moment, I think that's harder for companies to see. For one thing, their competitors aren't getting ahead by working more efficiently, but for another, people don't have much else to do (so work a ton of extra hours to accomplish the same amount) and are often afraid of losing their jobs. Take that out of the equation, and I have a hard time seeing companies wanting to keep people primarily wfh. Even in the current situation, my partner's company is planning on firing over half their fresh college grads because they aren't getting the work out of them they expect at home (definitely a very crappy situation).

I think that medical professionals will be first in line everywhere. Immunocompromised will only be after likely super-spreaders (essential employees) in most states. You don't get the vaccine now; we don't have enough in any state to vaccinate all essential medical workers, who are much more likely to get the virus than you are. Changing jobs to get earlier in the line pretty much requires taking on a lot of risk.

My suggestion is to take just 5-10 minutes trying or doing one of those things you say you want to do or trying something new. It's surprising how much you can do in a short period of time.

What helps me is setting a positive intention for each day and creating a loose but structured schedule (esp. if you're unemployed or working from home). For example, early morning is wake-up / shower / get dressed / self-care, late morning is work time, noon is lunch, early afternoon is creative time (for projects or games), and late afternoon is exercise and outdoors time, etc.

A positive intention I might set for myself is to learn how to bake lemon poppyseed bread, or reorganize the dresser, or reconnect with an old friend or family member. These small accomplishments make you feel productive and can inspire even more.

Im not in the same boat but what you are feeling is completely normal and millions are going through this. The world is changing. Societys norms are breaking down. We were a society of always doing, being busy, productivity, our value can be attached to our jobs. You may be seeing your friends out doing things but no one knows how theyre feeling inside or other factors (finances, health, family stress etc). So we must be careful not to compare. The people getting aid and not working will eventually run out and that is terrifying so every single day my suggestion would be to write down at least 3 things youre grateful for right now. Gratitude is transformative if you make it a practice. You will magnetize better things for yourself. So yes you might feel super grateful you have an at home job and security. Meanwhile when we go into lockdown it can be a transformative time within your own self as well. I personally believe this is a gifted time if we let it be. We all could to be looking at what is important for each of us, what is and isnt working, what are our gifts and passions, how can we contribute to self love/self-care and how can we contribute to society. Many of us are feeling lost and trying to navigate this new era. Its important to allow yourself time to breathe and just feel low or no motivation and be ok with it for a little while. Earth is grieving. Let yourself grieve for a little while then get more support to carve out self care for yourself. Like today I will take 1 hour a day to journal my feelings or whats going on, write a gratitude list, read a book, meditate, do some yoga, take a walk in nature, write down thoughts of what you could do if money or time were no object, what do you love to do and can lose yourself in? Then take time to connect with friends or family. Basically allow yourself time to do nothing, to be lazy, to eat crap BUT a limited time then get back to finding even 1 self care thing and it should grow from there hopefully. Allow yourself time for self introspection of what you want your life to look like. Sometimes writing down what you dont like first helps get you going. Just be gentle with yourself, youre not alone. We will get through this. Good job for reaching out! If you feel depressed BetterHelp is available 2 week free trial I think and Im pretty sure there is a free Covid stress mental health hotline if youre having too tough of a time depending on where you live.

It is something you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy.

A lot of people have made some excellent suggestions for long-term solutions, but if you want to try something that might help now:

You know that saying the best way to tackle a huge, seemingly insurmountable goal is to break them down into smaller tasks? That's the principle you need to apply here. Instead of telling yourself you need to fix your life, think of it as ""what are the small things I can do right now to make me feel better about life?""

Give yourself one task to complete each day. Start with small things, like ""Today I will brush my teeth"". Keep doing that, gradually adding more tasks (""I will drink 8 glasses of water"" ""I will go out for a walk"" etc) and afterwards make the goal of completing these for several days in a row (""I will cook myself at least one meal for a week"" ""I will do some form of physical activity for 3 days this week""). 

I recommend trying the Fabulous app, which is habit tracker app that teaches you how to build habits. It starts with small things like eating breakfast, drinking water etc so it won't overwhelm you. You mentioned in your post that are spending a lot of time gaming, so this might be a way for your to still ""play"" and develop healthier self-care habits.

Remember that you are not your feelings. Even if you are feeling unmotivated, depressed etc. it is not a reflection of who YOU are. The next time your mind starts telling you that you are a loser, that you're unlikable etc. do what I do: Stand in front of a mirror and tell my brain off for being unkind to me (yes I realize this makes me sound and look a little odd, but it works for me).

You are surviving in an unprecedented global crisis and that is all you need to do: survive. Don't be so hard on yourself.","6"

I wrote that all with the assumption that nobody cares and I should just cope with my stuff one way or another. Especially when there's people dealing with much harder things in life than I am. Finding strangers in the internet actually giving you good tips and understanding your situation is very heartwarming, when you haven't had a meaningful conversation in months.

I understand that I have to give some serious consideration for starting to take meds. I actually don't know why I haven't even done it yet. I've tried them during my late teens for a short period when I was dealing with some other stuff and it wasn't a positive experience (mostly I just needed some guidance and somebody to talk to, but the only thing available was SSRI), but I understand that I was much younger and not mature enough to take my mental health seriously. Also my attitude against meds has been that they are like a final resort and starting to eat them would mean that I'm admitting ""my failure"", and that this situation isn't going away on itself. I've also been afraid that they would change ""me"" or my personality to something different, but it's not like I'm something likable in my current state...

My therapist told me that it seems, that I don't like to be helped. And I think he's right about it. Growing up I didn't have much upbringing, but I learned to live by the idea, that in the end we are all alone in this world and you have to make your own way and survive. Eating meds would mean that I really need help, thus admitting my failure in life. And as I wrote that up, I realize how absurd and stupid that mindset is. I guess I just have to suck it up and try them, things could get even worse for me if I don't.","7"

Just be prepared for the initial phase when you feel yourself getting worse as Im your body adapts to the medication, and that you might have to experiment with different dosages and types etc before you find what works for you.

Also, if you are still gaming have you considered trying games with a social component where you can play at the same time with friends?

It fucking sucks and with the pandemic its hard to break out of it. Whats occurred to me is that rather than the extrovert/introvert distinction people here love, is the distinction between a publicly lived life and a privately lived life. Some people primarily live in one or the other and some people such as myself may have primarily sought solace in public (to escape the private) and obviously theres vice versa too. But for a public person this is especially hard because were forced by (either law or morality) to live in only one sphere and if this isnt your preferred sphere than there really it isnt an escape, only numbing. Like you I also have been unemployed for nearly the entirety of the pandemic(finally coming out of that at last), the only person I see is my ex who dumped me, and I have been seeking solace in numbing myself with video games (and if I didnt impose rules on myself like  if I drank yesterday I cant drink today alcohol would be more of a problem but thankfully I caught that quickly when it was clear this wasnt ending any time soon.).
Like you I also feel boring, I used to go to shows and be able to talk about things but now every day is the same and even the hobbies I have found are actually boring to talk about. 
Things wont get better outside until people are vaccinated, so try not to think about the public life but focus on managing the private life. 

This is going to sound stupid but things that have personally helped me get back some sanity despite being a self described unemployed loser:

* setting an alarm every weekday to a time that is earlier than preferableearlier because than you feel slightly more accomplished even though its bullshit that society moralizes sleeping lateeven if theres nothing to do its to trick your body into feeling accomplished. 

*Try to brush your teeth, doesnt matter what time, usually I only get around to it in the afternoon but reward yourself that if you do it youre doing a good jobI have a relative who went 20 years without brushing; brushing today is a fucking accomplishment. I am now getting to the point where I even floss! 

*Calendar: even if its just reminder to apply to  a job today or to file unemployment or grocery shop, or brush your teeth, or shower, checking things off a list helps me get a small since that I actually did something today.

*Reading 15 minutes a day with a timer: helps feel less boring because at least I will come out of this as someone who reads and at least whenever I am able to date again I will have something to talk about hopefully. I started this in December with 10 minutes a day and its helped me a lot more than you would think. 

*try to step outside everyday even when its kinda pointless. Just walk around on a quiet street with some music. I just feel worse when its been a few days","8"

\- If you have not been vaccinated yet, do so. There is some evidence that suggests long haulers can get some relief by becoming vaccinated. (I understand it's hard to come by in some states but continue to make it a priority either way)

\- Talk to your doctor about your options about medications to take or any ways for physical relief. I'd suggest bringing up a steroid shot, which is a fast way to get your body back on track after any illness generally. Again, I'm no doctor, so they'll know for sure what the right thing to do is.

\- Talk to your team about how you're feeling. They're your friends and colleagues after all- they may be more understanding than you think. If you need some time off to recover, take it. It'd be better for you to be out for a week and rest than to burn out completely. 

\- Talk to your partner about ways she can help relieve you of some of this burden you are clearly feeling. I'm sure she would be willing to help if you were clear on what you needed from her.

The best thing you can do right now is focus on resting and talking to your doctor about taking steps to manage and improve your condition. 

You may want to ask if drinking that much caffeine is having adverse affects. Things like a regular sleeping schedule and diet could help too.

It may help to also write to your boss and express these very concerns. If you are senior and needed there, they have no choice but to be understanding of your needs. So do detail your needs as far as work hours, time management, and whether you need to be working from home. Maybe a pillow fort is not out of the question.

Been saving for a property, but was planning to move out this year regardless (have saved up enough for a safety net, but probably got a long way to go before I can afford to buy a place). I get on with my family and do feel lucky that they are ok with my staying at home, but it had been a kind of point of shame that I still live at home. I know a handful of people the same age as me who are in the same boat, but for those who are living with housemates, the trade off is personal development/social/love life for a financial hit. 

I do feel kind of envious of my friends who are living together. I had some clashes with my dad early on throughout the lockdown, and I think it was due to the stress of the situation and getting a case of cabin fever. We usually get on fine, but it put a strain on things. I did feel like I was really missing out, looking at social media posts of people locking down with their housemates, having small house parties (amongst their household), etc. 

Later on though, I learned that those people I was a bit envious of were also clashing from being in such close contact all the time. One group of people had basically turned their house into a drug den, getting drunk and high every day. Another group (who I'm closer to) were partying quite a bit initially, but like I said, they eventually started clashing and getting sick of each other.","6"

I guess my point is the grass is always greener on the other side. I'd say just try to enjoy the situation with your parents as much as you can and remember that this too will pass and you'll have your adult ""freedom"" once again.

It really depends on the kind of relationship you have with your parents, but even then, not living independently can drive someone crazy, especially if you left home before. The thing is, there is a real benefit to daily social interaction and living in a family unit during times like these. Someone is always around to help or talk to. Furthermore, your friends may be living on their own, but it's not like they're having wild and crazy lives by going out and socializing (at least they shouldn't be...) There's nothing to do! They're probably doing the same shit as you, but not saving $$$ and perhaps a bit lonely. The real kicker is you are still employed and safely working from home.

I have been working on exercise, learning, meditation etc and it has been great so far. Looking towards myself instead of others in most situations has been a game changer. I can't wait to see how I can carry more of this physical and mental fitness into 'normal' life when it comes back. 

2.) Also, with how I've been seeing my friends behave during this pandemic (pretty careless for their own safety and pretty not- understanding of my want to be precautious) I am looking forward to expanding my social circle.
I'm not trying to sound cocky but I'm a decent person and somewhat interesting; I'm not perfect but I feel making new friends won't be too difficult. I still want to stay friends but I want to ensure that they aren't the only ones I rely on. 

I could keep going but I also landed a job that is a good jumping point for my career aspirations and I also play bass and have gotten considerably better since last March. 

As much as 2020 sucks, I don't think there was another year I have learned more about myself","4"

But I think I just needed this period of enforced semi isolation and at the end of the day Im good in a crisis (I freak out after) so I got to see some of my strengths. 

I think re-evaluating yourself during a major, disruptive event is totally normal. My partner and I made the decision to let go of most of our close, very long term, family like friend group. The fault lines were there but their actions during Covid made it apparent that there was no way for us to be truly happy and health while they were in our lives. It hurts but we both feel better about ourselves and our relationship now. I am so much more confident. I hadnt even realized but I had pretty much stopped talking about anything I was interested in to anyone besides my partner and my best friend who was no part of the larger group. I started doing a lot of volunteer work (no contact) and made a lot of connections in my community. I even got a job for the first time since my health went down and although that didnt work out it was a major confidence boost. My partner and I have really taken the time to work on some of our issues and our communication is so much better. 

At the end of the day I dont think any of that would have happened with our friend group and the boxes they had put us in. We outgrew them at some point and our state shut down was the excuse we needed to finally cut the cord from people who were invested in making sure we did not grow and who did not want to grow themselves. 

Covid sucks. My uncle died and my dad couldnt to say goodbye or attend the funeral. So many people are hurting. But for me there has been a silver lining that I am incredibly greatful for. 

I hope you and your husband are able to move forward happier and more fulfilled in life after this time of self reflection, it certainly sounds like you will!","6"

In fact I could have wrote this post up myself.  I'm in the exact same boat and I wish I had an answer for you, but I don't.  My housemate (who owns the house and like you, I can't afford to move) has done just about everything she can to expose herself to the virus.  However, back in January before they even knew what the virus was, she was suspiciously ill with all the symptoms (lack of smell/taste, lung issues, coughing, fever, etc) and had to go to the hospital, but recovered on her own.  I took care of her and spent close time with her and either I didn't get any symptoms, or I didn't catch it.  Either way, I have to wonder if she might be immune to it at this point because she continues to do or not do anything to really protect herself unless she is required to.  Course that doesn't include the people she invites over.  I just try to stay in my room, wash my hands, and have as little contact as possible.  The thing is that if she was sick back then, I took no precautions at all and managed to avoid it, I think.

I am so sorry about your grandmother.  We just had to put my 90 year old aunt in a nursing home and it sucks that we may not be able to see her because of the pandemic, even though she does not have it.  Best they said we could do is stand outside a window and peer in.  Big whoop.  I'm afraid that like your grandmother, she'll die alone and no one deserves that.  

So all I can offer is to hang in there.  I wish I had better advice.  Except maybe, and I know it's hard, try not to think about it.  I've had to give up with my living situation and just take it as it is.  It's not pleasant, but otherwise, I would go nuts and all she and I would do is fight and I don't want that.  We already had some pretty bad ones when it first started.","2"

Yeah. I try not to think about it too much; it just makes me so mad that my housemate is risking people's lives like this. I can probably protect myself--probably--but it means that I can't use the kitchen, can't get rides from him, can't hang out with him. Everything's suddenly gotten more complicated; for example, I have to get a document notarized at the library, and it's three miles away, and I'm trying to decide--do I walk there in the heat, or do I risk COVID by asking for a ride? It pisses me off that he literally doesn't care that he could get someone killed, and that he doesn't care that he's taking away the last little bit of freedom I had and the last social contact I was able to keep. I thought he was my friend, I really did. I thought he was kind.","2_1"

I was pretty upset about my housemate's lifestyle choices after the virus became well known.  But I realized that pushing her only makes it worse and it doesn't get me anywhere.  I've tried to show her studies and such and she listens, but it doesn't sink in.  It is very selfish and she has been quite selfish in that regard even though she is generally very generous in other areas.  I really do wish we were on the same page, but we aren't.  I just have to hope that she already had it and is now immune, or if I get it, I only get the mild version (if I hadn't already).  

As to the rides, would your housemate wear a mask while driving you and you as well?  Between that and open windows would probably be fairly safe.  Even just you wearing a mask would probably cut down the chances by a lot even if he won't.  You can use the kitchen.  Just get some Clorox wipes and wipe down the counters and stuff that gets touched.  They say now that viral spread is not from surfaces as much as they thought.

As for my aunt, thanks for the suggestion.  My sister and I are trying to arrange with the nursing home to do some facetime, so hopefully we can get that worked out.  We have a good friend that works there and he's been great about keeping us informed and getting her a TV.  She also has a roommate, which might help.  But she has been asking about us, and due to her dementia, can't remember that we are not allowed to just visit like you normally would.  So it saddens me that she can't see us in a normal way, but maybe tech will prove to be the answer.","2_1_1"

But I think you arent at as great a risk as you are perceiving right now and if you follow some common sense rules of the road you will be able to get through this safely. I even think its probably safe for you to go back to the library, especially if that would help your sense of isolation. 

First, there are only a few other people in your household, so the exposure risk isn't as high as if you were in a stadium or a music concert with people not exercising precautions. Given that people can safely care for sick members of their household even when they are actively shedding a lot of this virus, you should be able to navigate this completely safely by wearing a face covering when in contact with someone you think may be at high risk of infection and staying 6 feet apart from them. Eat your food in an area away from others. Use a separate personal facility and personal items. Clean the personal areas (e.g., sinks and toilets) before and after you use them if using separate facilities isn't possible.

If there is a shared space in your home that you use with others who are at risk due to their behavior, keep them well-ventilated and clean common surface regularly. I wish you the best in this trying time.","3"

No, I can't go back to the library. Being in constant contact with lots of people all day would be pretty dangerous. The spaces between the aisles are narrow; six feet is not possible. There are quite a few children. Spending twelve hours a week in a library is just asking to get the virus.","3_1"

However, you have a misconception about mask usage. There was unfortunate misinformation, at least in the U.S., about whether masks protect the wearer. Masks protect BOTH the wearer and those around them. Ill try to explain why you were misinformed about this by our leaders early in this public health emergency. 

Unfortunately, early in the pandemic public health officials had two hang-ups that prevented them from endorsing facial coverings as protective for the wearer. [1](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134) The first was that the regulatory guidance for certifying masks of any kind for personal protection required very specific uses overseen by trained respiratory and safety personnel. There was never consideration at the regulatory level that the general public might ever have to be counseled to wear respiratory protection and how to use it safely. [2](https://www.businessinsider.com/fauci-doesnt-regret-advising-against-masks-early-in-pandemic-2020-7) The second reason is that leaders, at least in the U.S., felt that it was important that the public not horde masks that are needed for the medical community. Since the mask supply for clinicians is stable now, the messaging has changed. It is truly unfortunate that we were all misinformed about the importance of facial coverings for the safety of the wearer.

The WHO has issued good guidance on how to wear masks in order to best protect yourself and others [link](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks)","3_1_2"

He went to a freaking Christmas party, got covid and and recovered  but then got post covid 4 weeks later ( after a clean bill of health for a little procedure 2 weeks ago ) there seems no ryne or reason for the post covid (well compromised I get ) 
Point is  its so important that you stay rested you are vulnerable and you are a priority . Try not to  go home and look stuff up . The icu teams are on I have been  also calling nurse and getting updates  and recording in person updates on my phone . I went down a rabbit hole about sedation and even wrote a letter for them to change the drug, then when I got there all prepared , they informed me that they had   just changed it in their own own . I should have slept . I keep reminding them he isnt some old guy , he is loved and funny and  we need him. 
Also being in icu the sedation really does give much needed rest in order to fight. I am also telling him he is doing great and to keep going and to come back ! I am snuggling now  with being very angry with his girlfriend for taking him to her sisters party . They have history but she seems stupid about it without any regrets . I mean whats done is done but ya, its so hard not to spiral, its maddening .
I truly hope you dad is okay  and that your drinking water and staying well  and eating real food !! its long hours that fly by and its like nah I am not hungry or some fast food and I am going to keep myself in check . I will be thinking of you, I know I will .
Ps I should have added that they found  a type of cancer and now some of the issues he had this year make sense .

I'd been slowly rebuilding, and was hitting my stride again in 2018-19. Concert and music fest cancelations hit hard in 2020, but I found new, simpler ways to enjoy life (more time outdoors in nature, teaching myself to draw, a few volunteer events at the end of the year, etc). Jan 6th and general extremism &amp; hate brought me back down and took some friends away, so I found a new job, met new people, and became a tourist in my hometown. I was grateful and excited when vaccines were rolled out and mask mandates lifted, went to a music fest, and was really starting to feel like myself again. All of that began to wane when I noticed that no one I encountered shared my sentiments, and for the first time in my life, I now feel awkward and socially anxious. My heart sinks when friends and family members go out of town, to theme parks, concerts, and all the things I've been dying to do with others.

I do attend concerts and still do my 2021 hometown tourist events alone, meet wonderful people from all over the country that I still text with, and for those few amazing hours I'm alive again.

I enjoy making cheesy disco playlists to listen to, it's good to get away from the news cycle. The first 2 weeks were tough but now I really look forward to it and I'm walking 3-4 miles day.

I made a post a few days ago mentioning that I just don't feel like I'm even alive. I feel like I have died already, and I'm just confined to doing the same repetitive things day in and day out, like a ghost. 

I don't want to die. I want to live. I want to live so desperately, but I cannot. 

I'm a highschool student, and my classes are supposed to go back in September. I've been looking foward to this day for months, but so many of my classmates talk about going back to school as if it were so unimportant. Some say they won't go back simply because they are ""too lazy to wake up earlier and commute"" and prefer to stay at home. None of them seem to feel as isolated and depressed as I do. You basically summarized my biggest fear: that very few people show up and I end up alone in that gigantic school, even more lonely than I already am.

I know it might be childish, but I can't help but feel insulted when my classmates refuse to go to school out of laziness or just ""hating masks"" and are super happy to remain stuck inside. It takes all of my hopes for the school to end my loneliness and shatters it before my eyes.

Sorry, I'm just ranting at this point. But I'm really struggling to find people I can relate to, so I figured that knowing I feel the same as you could help. I won't say anything cheesy or give you cheap advice, because I know too well how it always makes everything worse. But I want you to know that this teen, probably on the other side of the planet, feels as lonely and frustrated as you.

Similarly, are there restrictions on who can play outside - can she organize basketball sessions in the local park with friends and/or have an outdoor birthday party? 

If cases are high in your area schools may have gone back online because if they didn't, classes would be more disrupted by positive teachers needing to take time off, children missing out when they tested positive etc. Online gives consistency.

I hate the new normal term as well, its not good. I dont know what the answer for your situation is; I will say that here in the UK most things are starting to get back to how they were before, except in most offices where people are mostly being encouraged to work from home if they can, with the aim restarting in some way early next year. But pubs, shops, restaurants, are pretty similarly resembling what they did before. Theres even talk of gigs restarting again before the end of the year, though I imagine these will be small-scale in places like bars. It goes without saying that your experience of the next couple of years is going to depend largely on what country youre in, so if its really getting that bad for you, then you may want to consider moving abroad if possible. Social interaction of any kind is good for you in times where you feel isolated.

Im in good company; a lead who scientist recently said he expects vaccines to be available worldwide mid-2021, Fauci said a few days ago he expects full normality in the USA around mid next year, Kluytmans a Dutch specialist and part of our government response team expects the ""1,5m"" society to last until spring next year, van gucht in Belgium expects mid next year, van ranst and van Damme also in Belgium second half of next year.

One thing I keep reminding myself is that the world has been through things like this before and has always eventually gotten back to normal. There's this nice commercial in my country that has a 100 year old woman talking about how she was born during the Spanish flu. And that, despite coming into the world at a hard time, both she and her family had lots of good to live through as well. 

Plus, we have much better ability to treat this quicker than something like that Spanish flu. So, it really sucks right now. But we can at least find hope in knowing that it won't last forever, even if it feels like it.

I'm really sorry you're dealing with this. This is a time of uncertainty, stress, and fear for all of us. Is your bf the kind of person who usually keeps his feelings to himself? If so, have you found any good methods for getting him to open up in the past? If he is usually not the one to hide his feelings, then just be honest with him. Communication is so important, especially now. Let him know that you are concerned about the impact this may have on his mental health if he suppresses all of his feelings. Maybe even simply remind him to take care of himself, both physically and mentally. Remind him on a regular basis if you need to. Just let him know that you are there for him. If you think about it, you *are* supporting him by doing your part in staying home and self-isolating.

I just begin to feel so trapped and tired. The constant repetitiveness of the days. Wake up, change baby, feed baby, feed myself, laundry, clean, entertain, dishes.... And because it's winter it sucks even more. During the fall we'd take breaks and wall around our neighborhood. We'd walk down to the pond that's a ten minute walk from the house. We'd walk down to the little mom and pop store and get ice cream or popsicles (at least me and my stepdaughter would, he'd fall asleep in his stroller). We would even enjoy a day outside and play on the trampoline. He'd crawl around, and we'd sit him in our laps and bounce slightly. 

Now, with the weather being below freezing....the blizzard....we don't do anything. It's just so

It annoyed me a lot, but somehow it freed me. From then on I stopped being so careful, and I feel like life is back to normal.
Recently I traveled for work, so I wore a mask in crowded areas (waiting in lines at the airport etc). But apart from that, I'm done.

If you are 30 and don't have any health issues, covid should not be such a worry for you. Get your vaccines, wear a mask in risky places (transports, doctor's appointments etc) but otherwise you just have to accept covid is one of the diseases that exist, like the flu, stomach flu and other diseases which are very unpleasant but part of life.

I think the initial strategy of waiting for things to get better is no longer applicable as it seems it will never go away now. Just have to live with it and be careful when relevant.
Hope you manage to get there!!

Firstly, though I was never as serious as you about lockdown, I too feel like I've time travelled a few years. But not in a cool way. Also I was in a cult last 6 years and especially integrated into it last few years. I got out a few months ago, thank God. Here I am a little balder, no less broke, still no real friends, and only that much closer to old age. I'm estranged from my evangelist family at this point, so I'm definitely super alone in this, plus I live in my car! Enough to make you bummed out about shit. When I first busted out of the cult and made it back to where I was living and working before, I was feeling a little hopeless, a little bit like everything is kind of pointless... Tbh, it's just a funk. You gotta just shake it off, do all the things you know you should be doing, and most importantly making friends with yourself. That last bit is key.

 I went the whole last two years never catching it. I finally got it earlier this month. I was super worried about it turning into long covid but sure enough once I tested negative on day 12 I was on an epic upswing as of that day. It never turned into long covid. It really comes down to how good of shape you're in and age. If you're overweight, I highly recommend making it a priority to lose it, and get into good shape. Get super active =M<ü","4"

Moved out on my own last year, been super careful, get groceries delivered, I don't go out where there's a lot of people, quit the gym, started working out at home, work remotely as well.

I noticed wow, there's a lot I do on my own alone at home now. I go for runs outside, but I avoid trails where I might be near others. I also read a lot of threads on Reddit about Covid. Most of the time, these threads are from people and about articles so far from where I live in situations so completely different from my own.

I also notice that a lot of the fear I have around covid in general is generated by anecdotes of people on here. ""Sick as a dog"", ""Flattened me for days"", ""Worst sore throat of my life"", ""Six months of no smell"", ""Fatigue and brain fog since 2020"", ""Insomnia for weeks"", ""I'm fully vaccinated, live like a hermit and I'm terrified of long covid"". All from people with 3, 4 shots. Sound familiar? It makes me miserable reading this so I've limited how much browsing I do here now. This place isn't representative of reality, and neither are peoples anecdotes about the virus

Maybe you'll get it, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll suffer long covid, maybe you won't. Unfortunately we just can't get that assurance we'll be 100% ok. Uncertainty is scary. We assume the worst is true and will happen. Worrying about the what ifs and possibilities is like worrying about your house burning down. You can worry so much in advance of it happening that you make yourself sick, and what about when it happens? You deal with it in the moment using the same resources you always had.

That's what's been helping me recently. I've been telling myself long covid isn't a certainty, it doesn't do me any good to worry in advance of getting it, and even if I did get it, and I mean the things that scare me most: fatigue, brain fog, insomnia, loss of smell and taste for months I believe I can handle it and would recover. There's also a reason so much of the general public appears so careless about the whole thing. People have weighed the risks and make their choices. There's something to be said for that as well whether you feel it's wrong or right.

If you're not comfortable doing certain things now, then when? What would it take? Is it worth putting things off indefinitely due to an uncertainty of some hypothetical worst case scenario? I'm not telling you to be careless and go all in. Things are still very hard for me and I'm only just now considering testing the waters a bit but I think it's important to be aware of how you're thinking about things and how that translates into your actions around all this. There's obviously a part of you yearning for some change, and a bit of experimentation might help a bit with this.","5"

My husband and I realized we don't know if we feel confident driving an RV across country, especially during the winter although that is what we feel safest with.

But for me it's the no contact check ins. I am diabetic and just not sure if this is safe enough. We don't plan on making contact with anyone on the way but there's always that chance of an accident or medical emergency (our oldest often gets respiratory issues in winter that have at times required an ER visit - do not want to be stuck in the middle of nowhere looking for urgent care...). There's no way of knowing for sure. But even with our risks we are leaning more and more toward that plan. We would travel from the west to northeast and it will take at least a week so several overnights with two littles. We have even considered booking the Airbnbs for a few days before we actually arrive to have 48-72 hours between stays. We have been working and schooling from home since early March and have not entered any retail stores or restaurants - only interaction has been doctor/dentist as necessary. If we do this we will also be getting Covid tests prior to leaving. I don't think it's crazy but the stop to see family might be dangerous. We, too, were thinking of stopping to see my dad along the way but I told him we would truly only stand out in the yard more than 6 ft apart with masks, no hugging.

One thing boss did was ask everyone what they needed to feel safe, and I think face masks might happen. My husband says at least his new immediate boss seems to care.

My husband actually has a virtual interview next week, and we're crossing our fingers. It would mean a big move (halfway cross the country), but we have a friend who works for the company, and they are not treating him like a dollar sign.

The company has a good reputation because people who start from the bottom can end up in higher roles, but they never move past a point.

I cant logically or rationally support many of the measures being taken after pouring over evidence and numbers (please dont argue with me about this, thats not what Im here for). So Im dealing with the anger and stress and everything surrounding that combined with all of the same fears and frustrations youre having, so youre doing better than you think! 

The work thing, I cant fix. A lot of people like working remote. But a hell of a lot dont. And even some of those who say they will permanently, well I have a feeling theyll change their tune when that forever starts for them. There is no substitution for face to face interaction with coworkers and clients in the workplace, and it will still happen, just maybe with a few less people. 

I have the same mask wearer anger as you, it is so strange and makes them seem hardly human, however I try to remind myself that they are doing what they think is right for others, which is possibly the best human quality they can have. But it wont last forever. Everyone has a fatigue level with things and I think most people are hitting it with the covid stuff. There was lockdown fatigue, finally people said fuck it I cant stay home anymore and went out. Even some of those who were absolutely terrified at first are going out and living. The mask wearing will fatigue as well, look at how many people are already fighting it, or pulling them down constantly because yes, they suck. Not here to argue on that either for everyone reading, just showing that no people cannot keep up these drastic measures for long before they fatigue and say fuck it. This will not last forever, and it likely wont last as long as your head is telling you it will right now. With all the resistance weve seen so far on most of this stuff, theres no way that wont increase as it goes on. Just try to breathe and remember, there are humans behind the masks and none of us want to be doing it. There isnt one person I can think of that is actually thrilled about any of this, regardless of what reading some of the posts and subs on here will make you think. There are people that have been so scared into being thankful and possibly happy for all these measures, but they are the very loud minority. Most feel like you but many are scared to express that to others, that theyre sick of the lack of personal connection and its driving them mad. Regardless of whether or not you support all the measures taken, I think most can agree this sucks, and I know many people who are not even close to coping okay with this right now.

Counseling is a good place to start, but you seem to know that. Telehealth sucks, I speak from plenty of experience. If you can find an in person counselor, that would be ideal, even with masks it will help you to get your feelings out there some. It may not be a fix. I have a counselor and it hasnt been helping lately, but it doesnt hurt. I wish someone would put me in a coma and wake me up in a year or two so I feel you. I have anger as well, its probably my biggest emotion and I will admit I havent found a way to cope completely yet. I grab my dog and take a walk to our favorite park, where people are usually maskless and friendly and it makes me forget about all this for a bit. Or I go to the gym and just go ham, or take some CBD and knock myself out. 

I would recommend getting out to places that dont require masks.  Do you golf? I didnt before all this but I stared to when I was so bored during lockdown. Its nice because you dont have to wear them at the golf courses (at least where I am) and you are around people and inevitably end up talking to some of them out here, whether its at the range or if youre paired up with someone for a round. Do you have friends to go out to eat with? I know the servers masking up sucks but at least you can sit at your table with people and see their faces and it feels personal. My coworkers went for socially distanced golf and then beer last week and had a blast, even distanced.  

I dont know what to say because Im dealing with the same feelings. All I can say is to distract yourself. Try therapy, cant hurt too bad. Head down, buckle down, and know that people will not let this continue for an unreasonably long amount of time. Most are getting to the point where they realize theres no point staying alive at all costs when this is the life we have to have to do so. Life is not worth living if this is what its going to be for too long and people are realizing that.","6"

Second time I'm positive it was Omicron as that was the dominant strain in my area, plus I heard Delta infections had little protection to the Omicron strain, which makes sense why I got sick so fast again. It's also more contagious.

It's impossible to know which you'll be without having done it, though thinking about how introverted or extroverted you are and what worked for you in school when on campus might help you find the right thing for you. Remember, all those terms really mean is whether you ""charge your batteries"" more by being alone or with people, and even within one person, that can vary a bit and is more of a spectrum than an absolute. I love socializing, but it also drains me, so I need alone more personally, so I love living alone, have even been known to be a bit of a hermit at non-pandemic times (I live with my bf now, but was living solo for a long time). You know you, and what you need for self-care, and living alone right now has some extra challenges worth considering.

Living with family can be tough or solve a lot of problems (at least temporarily), you don't mention what it's like for you, just the financial aspects. Can you be your true self there? Do you get along with your parents? Just well enough, or do you like living with them, just generally ready to fly the coop? I'm guessing it can't be bad there, or you would be gone without asking strangers, but think about your lifestyle there and the good and bad of it, because you know that one well.

The other option is to compromise, set yourself a date a few months out and save like mad so you can launch with a slightly larger safety net.

I'd also take a look at real estate prices, I live in a very expensive city right next to a most expensive city, and keep hearing rents are getting much more reasonable now, when you factor in rent control (depending on city), could be a great time to get in on a good deal for a long time, if you decide to stay there. A whole lot of people are moving and the market appears pretty clogged with places (my building has only us in it right now!). That could also mean it's a good time to negotiate on your move-in package cost. Take a virtual apartment hunt and see what's available at what price in your target city, check out neighborhoods and daydream about them being your home, that might help you make this decision. Worst case, you have a little fun seeing what's out there and learning about the city. :) 

Good luck!","1"

J&amp;J initially did their first trials with one shot, while the MRNAs did theirs with two off the bat. J&amp;J did this partly because they knew the economic and resource benefits of an effective single dose. They have now started a trial to see how a second dose will (most likely ) boost their efficacy to similar numbers as that of the MRNA vaccines. While Pfizers ceo has publicly said they are prepared to offer boosters and think they will likely need them, thats still not even established. Boosters may be needed for better protection against circulating variants in the future or to boost waning immune levels. We will only know if either of those are needed after some time to show how long all the available vaccines last. So taking one or the other doesnt really guarantee you wont need a booster in the future. 

With that said, J&amp;Js numbers are very promising but if you have a choice, I would personally want the highest efficacy available and would go with a MRNA. Personally, I would choose Pfizer because it seems to have a slightly smaller amount of people who experience the harmless but unpleasant side effects of dose two. Of course, statistics cant really guarantee how youll feel either way since everyone is different. Really just an odds game there. 

On another note, I am fully vaccinated and took Moderna because it was available to me. I did have the normal flu like side effects after dose two. Was much less dramatic than my anxiety and a lot of people made me feel like it would be. Would only try Pfizer if I could go back and have choice just because Id of course be happy to not feel a little under the weather if given a chance to avoid it.

Heres this study that will hoepfully clear things up for you.

&gt;Reports of Long-COVID, are rising but little is known about prevalence, risk factors, or whether it is possible to predict a protracted course early in the disease. We analysed data from 4182 incident cases of COVID-19 who logged their symptoms prospectively in the COVID Symptom Study app. 558 (13.3%) had symptoms lasting &gt;28 days, 189 (4.5%) for &gt;8 weeks and 95 (2.3%) for &gt;12 weeks.

The study also shows a distinct pattern of *who* has ""Long COVID"" most often; it's mostly the same cohort who are at most risk of death (advanced age, poor health) with the interesting difference of being heavily female (most who die are male).

This was only based on people with symptoms, as well; estimates of how many people never have any symptoms at all (fully asymptomatic) vary quite a bit (between 20 and 80%).

Just like dying from the disease, a relatively small percentage ends up being enough cases across the population to be staggering; but for the individual your risk is relatively low.

If its any consolation everyone in my extended 2 families has already gotten COVID and all of them feel just fine now with no lingering damage. I would get checked by your doctor just in case you do have some sort of medical problem to be safe, but it might just be some form of paranoi/mental health issue. I have OCD, and one of my obsessions would be feeling very dizzy all the time these past months but once I forgot about it it turned out that I feel completely fine.

Each person comes with their own risks attached. If everyone is essentially isolating before the meeting, either working at home or taking school from home, everyone is low-risk. If the three people who work outside the home do so in low-risk situations (don't travel to work on public transport, work in a office/yard/warehouse where social distancing is possible and everyone wears face coverings where appropriate) then they're also low-risk. If they don't, start to think about where the risks lie and how likely they are. Think about it as rating everyone on a risk scale of 1-100, where 1 would be someone who lives alone, works from home, has their groceries delivered and never socialises, and 100 is someone is a COVID denier who doesn't think the pandemic is a thing, never covers their face and is going to parties every other night with people who act the same way. 

You probably wouldn't be willing to meet up with someone who scored 100 on that scale. But would you be willing to meet up with a group of people who, cumulatively, score 100? The UK advice for Christmas is no more than three households, with no more than 8 adults (=over 12, or High School age, in this situation). You don't say if any of the group are children but even if they are it sounds like this group is right on the edge of what's considered safe. 

So, there's no hard and fast rule, but consider where there are opportunities for risk to enter the system, consider how likely it is that it will, and go from there. And do what works for you - don't be bullied into going or not going by the rest of your family, even if it is Christmas.","4"

Good to hear an independent, informed risk assessment. I think we (I) can manage the 14 days this time. I think the likelihood of this happening again and again that is wearing on me... will I be effectively a single parent for most of the winter? The exposed employees are allowed to continue to work as long as theyre asymptomatic. That seems to me like a recipe for continued infections of members of the department (a rotating cast of 50 people, 6 in the room at a time). Notwithstanding that community acquired infections are likely to occur among employees as well. Anyway, I had heard about nurses and doctors and respiratory therapists moving out for months due to the infection risk, but I never really considered it a possibility for my husband because his job as a telemetry tech is remote from patients.

I'd said that ''X' is 14 days from exposure - the amount of time by which almost everyone who is going to develop symptoms will have done so. The average time to develop symptoms is 4-5 days after exposure.

If you can't bear 14 days, every day after day 5 is less of a risk but still a risk.

Based on your reply above, l'd ask if allowing the 'exposed' employees to continue to work is based on robust risk assessments of their masks (medical grade, properly fitted and removed safely?) and air conditioning systems in their working environment? If so and the workplace has assessed that in these conditions your husband is sufficiently protected that just being in the same room as someone who has tested positive isn't cause to assume infection it may be worth trusting their judgement. 

You could take some milder precautions such as him sleeping in a different room, keeping windows open if possible and him wearing a face covering around you, while not actually moving out - particularly if there's  no reason to think either of you is high risk.","2_1_1"

I dont think any fitting support is provided to these employees in particular since they are not in contact with patients. I dont know anything about the ventilation or filtration. Given the proximity and duration, my guess is that the ventilation and filtration would have to be excellent to get to low risk.

If you can, try emphasizing that wearing a mask is to help the poor people who work at the salon. Yes, it is true that the vaccine protects you and your daughter. You know that your daughter is vaccinated, your daughter knows she's vaccinated, but the poor workers don't *know* that. Lots of people are lying about being vaccinated and going maskless and they are the primary reason why this pandemic is ongoing.

Hopefully your daughter is willing to do simple things to make other people comfortable. She would be wearing a mask to make one poor salon worker feel less scared.

Outside of this, you might consider getting your daughter some counseling. Let her chose a therapist, life coach, or someone she feels comfortable with so she can have an outlet. It's hard to remember being that young, but all people learn to deal with emotions through experience, usually by making mistakes. Your kid has been deprived of opportunities to have experience dealing with emotions around people her age this year, and she could probably use some help processing. Seeing that you don't think her lashing out was okay and now there's an action plan for coping with it may help the yelling at service workers from becoming a reoccurring trait. Best wishes!","6"

Of her sibling and herself, she's the one who is old enough to remember biodad, and that wasn't a pretty situation.  Coping with the memories of that, and knowing he's currently a guest of the state is hard on her.  I'm fortunate we have as awesome of a relationship as we do to be honest, particularly considering how it started when I first married her mom almost 8 years ago.  

Anyway, she's extremely resistant to any sort of counseling.  When she was younger we took her to a psych that I used to see for my own mental illness (tbh I prefer to say neurodivergence, as it's managed well enough through my doctor and medication that no one would know otherwise, but I digress).  At the time she had a tendency to fly into rages and struggled mightily to control her emotions.  He put her on a pretty heavy medication meant to stabilize her emotions, and it wound up turning her into a zombie.  We took her off of it (under his guidance of course) almost right away and since she's been adamantly opposed to seeing someone.  Thankfully we conquered the outbursts together not long after.

Before the pandemic we were able to get her to speak with the school counselor after the ice was broken between then when she was involved in an incident at school (victim/witness, not instigator).  But during the pandemic she refused, likely in part because with 5 of us in the house all home all the time, finding a quiet, safe place where no one could walk in or overhear is nearly impossible (let me tell you how fun that's been for all of our mental health throughout this).  

As for using other people to inspire empathy, I'll be 100% honest, at times I wonder if she doesn't have a difficult time with empathy.  She tends to live her life as though we're all characters in her story, and any obstacle anyone might put in the way of what she wants is a personal affront to her, even if it's completely out of anyone's control.  This isn't always obvious, but it seems pretty consistent.  Some of it certainly is typical teenager stuff.  But it's been that way since the beginning, and sometimes it's so egregious as to be utterly shocking.  Then again, she's *fiercely* protective of her siblings, and sometimes her friends.  Freshman year is either going to be really easy or really hard on her sibling that's 3 years younger.  Typical ""I get to push them around and make fun of them, but you don't!"" sibling stuff, or so I gather from my wife who has a brother, I'm an only.

Oh, and in case I wasn't clear--she lashed out at myself and my wife, not at the workers.  She wouldn't do that without a good reason, though what a good reason is to her is sometimes hard to pin down--but even then she wouldn't yell, she'd just dish out a tongue lashing.  But as with most kids, she's typically extremely well behaved in the presence of other adults.  It's when it's just us that things aren't all skittles and rainbows.  

I suspect she will get over it, and to her credit, she did wave a mask somewhat sassily in my direction to show she was bringing one when she left the house.  I'm not looking forward to the conversation about her needing to wear one at work though.  Especially since our state has pretty much shrugged and said it's up to the counties/businesses themselves, and none of them want to risk the wrath of anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers to re-implement masking.  She's likely to be the only one wearing one between a dozen staff and 4 dozen customers.","6_1"

One of the reasons we have been so strict is the safety of my mother. My mom provides safe free child care and as long as we protect our bubble we minimize her risk. This week our kids went to the dentist so we are not allowing them to go over for 7 - 10 days. The grandparents allow my wife and I the ability to retain/perform our jobs so their involvement is crucial for our success at our jobs. 

The info on my 5 year old is appreciated.  Shit is super scary when it happens. There have been more occurrences but we were able to mitigate the situation at home with albuterol. I kinda figured it was just a light or moderate form of asthma and nothing to major overall. 

None of my kiddos are obese but I would qualify as such. However my risk hasnt been a focal point of the concern - our mothers have been. 

We would likely be more open to guests and visits if it weren't for the grandparents but even without them I would still expect us to discuss our risk factors as we scheduled events. 

The BIL and SIL feel like I am attacking them and should just trust them. This rift has been growing since they invited 20+ people over for Memorial Day and we did not attend. The only couple that did do not have kids. 

My wife and I are struggling with this too. She believes the risk is worth the reward and I agree... I just want to fully understand the risks and be able to schedule kid care around our visits.

Parents also need to weigh the risk of their children catching covid against the potential impact of long term social isolation and lack of extra curricular activities.

Since, SIL has had friends in the house on two separate occasions as well as in the hot tub.","1_1"

In-law situations can be sticky. Covid constraints and respecting safety are complex.  Put them all together and you get a lot of stress!   With my extended family, i keep expectations low. I do this for my own mental health. I just sort of assume they have poor distancing and masking practices when not around me.  By being pessimistic about their hygiene, I am more vigilant to maintain distance myself. In my experience during this pandemic other adults dont want to be told what to do, we just have to look after ourselves.  And if they ask why you are eating dinner in the other room, you can say Im just worried about someone getting sick (that someone is you).  If they expose themselves theres nothing you can do, sadly.","2"

It was awful, and speaking up was the hardest part. They live 5 minutes away. but we are soooo much happier now. DM me if you want advice on how we handled it :)","3"

I have very bad anxiety and I have been going thru the same thing.  Shivering to the point where even using a heating pad doesnt stop it, I have lost so much weight from not eating due to stress and feeling nauseous when I do force myself to eat something, my sleep is terrible because I have a hard time falling asleep and then my toddlers wake me up 2-3 times every night.

But Ive really been focused on trying to go to bed earlier and listening to guided sleep meditations.  Ive started making smoothies with frozen fruit and yogurt to try to get some good nutrients and I feel like a blended drink doesnt make me feel nauseous as regular food does.   Ive also started taking a multivitamin and vitamin C. 

Ive woke up feeling a bit better the past few days and feel a bit more positive.  Its a rough long road ahead but Ive found that listening to positive guided meditations multiple times a day has started to help. Maybe try that.  This too shall pass and I wish you all the best =O","3"
