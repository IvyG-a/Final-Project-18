I definitely need a bigger desk just so that everything doesn't feel that crowded and my chair is a basic Ikea one. 

My office needs to approve the chair/desk I choose to buy. For chairs they need to be ergonomic which is nice but most of the good ones are $300 alone. 

I've only been working from home for a couple of months, so I'm asking you: would you rather splurge on a really good chair or a really good desk (I was thinking one of the ones with a motor that let you stand up)

Update: I know a lot of people here prioritized the chair, but I am not able to buy the items off Craigslist or any re-seller websites. Each really good chair goes beyond the $500 allowance since most of them are $800???
I ended up getting an electrical stand up desk so that I can stay active and I havent opened the $200 chair that met all the ergonomic requirements for it to be approved.

# And now it's time for the buyer's guide

First, think about the size of your workspace. Imagine the freedom of having a larger desk surface, with enough room for your computer, monitor, and other office supplies. Normally a good standing desk will have the tabletop of 48x24"", 60x30"" or bigger (72x30"" or 80x30"").

Then, look for a desk that can be adjusted to your height, giving you the perfect ergonomic position to work comfortably for long periods. It's so important because the taller guys above 6' may not like the desk with height range under 48"" at max height setting. A good height range from 22-23"" and up to 49-50"", that's standard!

Consider the material of the desk too - a classic wooden desk can provide warmth and elegance, while a modern metal desk can add an industrial edge to your home office.

Think about the desk's weight capacity: At least 176 lbs or great 220 lbs. That's the ideal one. Make sure the desk can support your computer, monitor, and any other equipment you use. Look for desks with higher weight capacities if you need to support heavier equipment. And of course with high-end products, they can support 355 lbs

# Benefits of using a standing desk while working from home:

1. Improved posture: Standing while working can help improve your posture, as it promotes a more natural position for your spine.
2. Increased energy and productivity: Standing can increase blood flow and oxygen to the brain, which can help boost your energy levels and productivity.
3. Lower risk of obesity and heart disease: Studies have shown that sitting for extended periods can increase the risk of obesity and heart disease. Standing while working can help reduce this risk.
4. Reduced back pain: Sitting for long periods can lead to back pain and other musculoskeletal issues. Standing while working can help alleviate some of this pain and discomfort.
5. Better overall health: Standing while working can provide numerous health benefits, including lower blood sugar levels, improved circulation, and reduced risk of certain types of cancer.","WFH",29,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/10uvuq2/best_standing_desk_for_work_from_home_from_under/"
"2023-08-15",1692122514,"Jumping on the bandwagon: RTO implemented for a team that was always WFH","TL:DR - A team that was fully remote for years prior to COVID is being told to return to office when they never were in-office employees to begin with. 

I switched jobs a little over a year ago to a team that was fully remote even before the pandemic. My job is similar to a data analyst at a large financial institution and requires me to periodically connect with individuals from all different departments who can be located in all different states. Most of my day is either spent on calls providing project updates or working on documentation and data visualizations. 

The company has now announced RTO not only for jobs that were in-person before the pandemic, but also now our team for reasons of collaboration and culture. The team I am on has less than 10 people, all in different states and the partners we need to work with are also in other states (Ive only come across 1 partner who is in my same state). My manager fought for us to remain remote since thats what we were before but their manager basically didnt want to hear it. My manager was on the brink of tears when he shared that he failed us. 

In addition to this expectation, the only locations we have ample space for the workforce in my immediate vicinity is in a major city. Parking is not free and is paid for out of pocket by each employee. There are no convenient parking garages nor lots as they were sold to build apartments or hotels around the office. When I took this job, I waited for about 2-3 months before re-doing my personal budget, essentially re-allocating money otherwise budgeted for work travel expenses to other goals (buying a house, paying down student loans, etc.). Now, Im being asked to foot the bill for gas, parking, car maintenance and other related expenses that were never expected of me, and all without any pay increase. 

Financial situation aside, I had a huge traumatic event before I transitioned to this role which basically drove me to find something fully WFH to help me handle anxiety and stress better and in a way that makes sense for me. My mental health is better, I can take walks when I need to re-center myself to prevent panic attacks, and I can control everything from light to temperature in my home office to help avoid me from feeling overwhelmed. 

Im just annoyed at the whole situation. Being in an office benefits literally no one. Ill be head down in an office the whole day and essentially taking office space from someone who may need it for clients or actual in-person collaboration. And Ill be more stressed out about my mental health and financial well-being.

I'm referring to basic upkeep such as dishes, routine bathroom/kitchen cleaning, vacuuming, making beds, scooping cat litter, tidying up, etc. While my partner acknowledges all that I do, and pitches in on bigger things when I ask, sometimes I can't help but get annoyed when he gets home from work and plops on the couch. I started working from home in March 2020 and prior to then, it was a 50/50 split on household chores, now it feels 90/10. 

I also know that I am lucky to have the opportunity during the day to get little things done. My work ebbs and flows, so at times it's very busy where I am all in for 8 hours a day, while other days are more routine work with some downtime where I just need to be present and available. Most of these little chores take only 5-20 minutes, or I'll start/stop go back to working then return. I spend my 30 minute lunch usually vacuuming, prepping something for dinner, watering plants, or folding laundry. 

I have voiced my opinion to my partner in the past, and he is super supportive. He'll tell me to leave something for him to do when he get's home. But then I fight with myself because I have the time and I'm here with the laundry or whatever task it is so why not just do it? I'm here with the food so why not plan and prep for dinner? Then we can just spend quality time together when we are both done working. There are just some days where I feel like everything falls on me. 

Finances are equal for the most part, but not combined, and bills are split down the middle. I would never ask him to, but is it wrong of me to say if he contributed more financially this wouldn't bother me as much? 

Am I unreasonable for sometimes feeling resentment? Anyone else in a similar situation? Do you leave things for your partner to take care of or do you just suck it up and be grateful that you're able to work from home?

"2024-05-06",1714968315,"What is the best standing desk in YOUR opinion?","Hi WFH-ers,

If you are experiencing back pain problems, mostly due to sitting for long hours in front of the computer, an ergonomic chair, even from a high-end brand such as Herman Miller or Steelcase, won't necessarily help you feel any better.

 Instead, you should stand up more and do more exercises. Running, walking, jogging, swimming, anything!

Working at home can make you feel lazier, no doubt about it. But if you don't have time for a workout, then a sit-stand desk can be a lifesaver. You don't need to stand more than 4 or 5 times each day, and each time you stand, there's no need to do so for more than 30 minutes.

And good news: NO need for high-end options with the price above $1k, you just need a $500 budget for a solid standing desk  
Of course, in my opinion, if you need the best, then some options have better height adjustment range, longer warranty, and more pricey, of course!

A few suggestions below, highly recommended for newbies 

* [Flexispot E7](https://standingdesktopper.com/best-standing-desks/#Flexispot_E7_Pro_Plus) (recommended by Standingdesktopper experts and also other Redditors) - Best for value &amp; quality, the base version only around $500, and 15 years of warranty. 3 types of frame, fit tall people, also short &amp; average folks 
* [Uplift V2](https://www.upliftdesk.com/uplift-v2-standing-desk-v2-or-v2-commercial/) (recommended by Nytimes Wirecutter) - starts from $569, but the brand aslo has high-end versions for above $1k (for example: https://www.amazon.com/V2-Commercial-Adjustable-Standing-Desktop-Advanced/dp/B07T2NT595). Easy for customize, easier for return if you don't like it
* [Vari Essential ](https://www.amazon.com/Vari-Essential-Electric-Standing-Desk/dp/B09BRF3QFK)(for someone who just need a basic stand up desk within $300, this is the brand you can trust)
* [Deskhaus Apex](https://standingdesktopper.com/standing-desks-for-petite-people/#Deskhaus_APEX_PRO) for short/petite people under 5'. If you live in Canada and need a cheaper option, then go with the [Ergonofis Sway desk](https://standingdesktopper.com/high-end-standing-desks/#Ergonofis_Sway_desk)
* [Vari Pro base](https://standingdesktopper.com/how-to-choose-a-standing-desk-for-tall-people/#Vari_Electric_Standing_Desk_Pro_Base) for tall folks above 6ft (at least you'll need the max height setting from 50"" or even higher)

I worked at my role in person until covid hit and then I've been remote since. My manager didn't start out like this, but has been progressively getting worse. If I had to guess, I would say their mental health has deteriorated due to something at home.

Today's example is I got a text at 7pm (and we start early, 6:30-7:30am) asking if I could log back in to get them a number from a project I'm doing and have a call because they needed to understand something. I ended up doing it because I have a performance review soon and I know I would have been criticized for not getting it until the next day. I've stood up for myself plenty of times before, like if it's 6pm on a Friday and tell them ""Unfortunately I need to wrap up my day, can we touch base on this Monday morning?"" but then I'm met with, we need to get this done by today. 

I understand that some things are urgent and I am more than fine with working late to get things done as needed and I've done that in this role for years. However, to my manager everything has become urgent. I just don't know what to do or say anymore. I would love some advice from you all. Thank you.","WFH",134,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/159wclf/how_to_handle_manager_texting_me_to_log_on_after/"
"2023-06-22",1687392062,"Don't underrate the strategy of just not listening to your company's RTO mandate","YMMV, if you get fired doing this, don't blame me.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen a fair amount of people at major companies share stories or personally hear how despite RTO mandates being ""enforced"" some individuals just.. don't do it.  


Usually your options are  


A: Follow RTO mandate (listening to THE MAN, oof)  
B: Apply for an exception from RTO mandate (low success rate)  
C: Quitting because you refuse to do RTO  


Don't undersell option D: Just continuing to WFH despite the mandate.  


I've found many companies aren't truly going to fire you if you just ignore the mandate. There may be exceptions of course, but I've seen enough examples of just ignoring the RTO mandate that I think the strategy is under-utilized by those who aren't ready to hop to a new job or want to stay at their job, but still WFH  


I think companies want you to RTO or to quit because you don't want to RTO. They typically aren't actually looking to fire you, but you're doing them a favor either abiding by RTO or willingly quitting so they don't owe you severance or unemployment pay. So when there are those who are just rebelling by still working from home, they aren't really looking to fire you even if they know you aren't showing up.

I have been working from home for the last 5 years and I love the flexibility of wfh and I cannot stand commuting. Heres the pros and cons with each company:

Company 1 (where I currently work):

Pros:

- Fully remote
- I have a good reputation here, get along well with most
- Limited office politics since wfh
- Good work/life balance 
- Manageable stress
- Very stable job 
- Glassdoor rating is 4.7 out of 5 

-Have animals that love me being home 


Cons:

- Lower range on salary for my field (Ive had the only promotion you can get for my role, so maximum raise going forward is 3% each year) 

-Boss is kind of weird and aggressive at times
- Im a mid level senior manager and there is no growth in site unless someone dies or retires (my peers have been in same position for over 13 years) realistically, Im looking at 7-8 years in same position
- Health benefits so-so
- Limited diversity 


Company 2-

Pros:

- Great salary- I could make $50-$60k more annually (base salary) plus annual bonus. 
- Interesting field
- Ability to learn a lot, autonomy to build out/restructure dept 
- Title I would want, if I stick it out for a year, itll set my path going forward for better salary and title.
- Benefits covered 100%

Cons:

- I found out the person before me was fired after 3 weeks, and found out in final interview 2 people have been fired for this role. (Hiring mgr shared they are fire happy)

-Major startup vibes 
- High turnover (although they say they are cleaning house for the better) 
- Glassdoor ratings are awful with it saying its a toxic environment- 2.5 out of 5 
- An hour commute there and back (2hrs)
- Fully in office 
- It seems like itll be high stress 

Ive left a stable job for more money before and have been miserable, but it lead me to this job which Im thankful for. Theres major red flags here, but I have the experience thats needed to change some things and it could set me up exponentially for the future.


Thanks for the response everyone! To give some additional context- I make $100k, so this would be a 60% raise for me. I would use the extra money to pay off debt, and save for my own place. I currently rent an apartment with a roommate. 

I live in CA where cost of living is extremely high. Im not open to move, I love CA. 

There would be a bump in title and money. I had to do some pre-work for the company as part of the interview process, and I actually know I can make new processes and new impactful changes, but the reviews and firing someone for 3 weeks makes me nervous.

Ive worked for startups before, and built departments from scratch- but I know how extremely frustrating and inept people can be. ","WFH",677,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/17m0rsl/would_you_leave_wfh_for_60k_more/"
"2024-04-03",1712170257,"The ""Lunch Nap"" has revolutionized my life","I've been full time WFH since Covid. Pre-Covid I worked a kind of odd shift due to on-site requirements, worked from 10am-6:30pm, this worked pretty well for me as I have never been a morning person. No matter what I do with my night-time routine, getting up bright and early, getting ready, getting breakfast, commuting, and being ready to go for normal 8am or earlier jobs has just never clicked with me and was always a huge struggle.

Once Covid hit our work schedule drastically changed. Was sent home with my equipment, and was given a new schedule of 6:30am-3:00pm. First year or so I really struggled with getting up and getting going in the morning, I often had a meeting first thing that required my participation and I definitely handed in some less than stellar performances on those meetings.

Despite no longer having a commute, having my evenings completely freed up, and overall loving the WFH life, I found myself still struggling with energy levels throughout the day. Was running out of steam every night around 6-7pm.

About a year and a half ago I was so tired one morning that I just decided to skip lunch and go lay down in my bed during my one hour lunch break. Set an alarm for 5 minutes from when my hour ended and I took the best nap of my life. Woke up feeling refreshed, and I carried that same energy with me for the rest of the day.

This nap is now just part of my daily routine. Every day at 11:30am I take a 50 minute nap. I'm no longer tired in the evenings, I wake up more refreshed than usual. Even if I had stayed up past midnight the night before my overall energy levels are just better despite sleeping about the same amount of time per day (including the 50 minute nap, I tend to stay up a little later now since I have more energy after work).

"2023-08-01",1690892296,"Just 4 years ago, working in an office was considered a real job.","I've been WFH for over 10+ years.  During that time I heard it all from my friends..

* ""So, you just sit around playing video games all day""?
* ""When are you going to get a 'real job'?""
* ""So, let me get this straight...you pay for the electricity, internet, buy your own equipment, and use part of your home as an office? Man, they must be saving a fortune on chumps like you!"".

3 years ago, those who were lucky enough to keep their jobs complained about having to do it remotely.  Albeit temporarily. I saw MANY articles and social media posts complaining about how workers were now expected to keep up the same level of productivity at home...without the office.  People were literally asking how long this would last and when they'd be able to get back to the office,

Then we did it. Productivity didn't suffer.  People who had never worked remotely before, had an epiphany.

Now, in just 3 years, no one wants to go into the office for those real jobs anymore. Now all I see are complaints that the temp situation they knew was temp, is now over and the company expects RTO...like they told you they would do from the beginning.

People comparing that there aren't any WFH positions anymore.

Look, people have been working from home since the 90's. There have always been remote  positions, its just that half the workforce wasn't looking for them.  That wasn't considered a real job 4 years ago.

If your job wasn't remote before, it's unlikely it will all of a sudden be remote now. If you're in a profession that is typically not remote, it's unlikely to change soon.

From where I sit there are more remote jobs than ever, but competition for them is steep. Just as attitudes among workers have now changed about remote work, the other thing that has changed is you now have to compete for those positions.

A piece of paper with your work history is not the only consideration now.  A piece of paper says you may be qualified to work in the office,  You need to show employers that you are set up to work remotely, have the equipment and infrastructure needed to be productive, present well, and can work will little supervision and still get the job done.

They'll train you to do the job, they're not going to train you how to be a great remote worker too. They're not going to tell you, you look like crap, you sound like crap, your camera looks like it's shooting through a potato ,or watch you struggle with WiFi issues for a simple Zoom call.  They don't want to hear whining about why you have to be on camera for a meeting.

They will expect that you're a work from home professional. If you're not, you're not getting that job. 

Last thing...If you haven't changed to a field that has always had a lot of remote opportunities, or are still doing the same job as before 2020, you're likely going back to the office same as everyone else.

JMO of course

"2023-09-01",1693576558,"""Let's Be human about this."" OK, you first.","I was hired as an exec to work for a place several states away at the beginning of the pandemic, with a relocation agreement. Since then I have exceeded all metrics -- my organization has been chaotic, and had three top execs, one of which told me not to worry about relocating. My agreement lapsed, and they gave away my office. I do go in periodically, but more often I travel on their behalf, and it's cheaper from my actual home location. They also save beaucoup taxes on my employment, since I'm in a state where they require less payroll taxes. 

So in January the newest exec was appointed over the second one, who had actually been running things for years for the first exec. It has been an unmitigated disaster. Immediately the new exec was blindsided with some regulatory issues that most of the company already knew about. We then reorganized -- I led my team through it, retaining almost everyone despite a lot of adverse situations. Overall we lost about a hundred people, and have been unable to do our jobs as usual for about 6 months now. Meanwhile in all this time there have been no raises, there were furloughs, and it's been an overall very frustrating situation. Right now despite being promised that we would be able to be more agile during the reorg, they're claiming I can't replace my only lost employee, even though the funding for her position comes from an external grant -- they don't even pay for it. Altogether, it's a pretty dissatisfying arrangement right now. 

Anyway, my boss, who's between me and the top exec, decided that I need to RTO now. We had a meeting where he blindsided me with this, and with some complaints about employees in other divisions abusing the remote employee arrangement -- I told him that has nothing to do with me, and I actually am technically hybrid, so it's not even a comparable situation -- and he basically said that I agreed to move and now I need to. He used the phrase ""let's be human about this."" 

I actually have no problem moving -- it's logistically difficult and we barely go into the office, even those who live right there, but I bought a house there when I was hired in anticipation of a move that now seems completely unnecessary so I'm actually kind of set up to do it successfully. With enough notice it's fine. There are even advantages. But it's not ""human"" to arbitrarily decide to make people work from an office where it's actually not necessary. Or, honestly, for a company that hasn't lived up to any of the promises that it made to me as an employee.

I've been working from home for several years now starting back in the mid 2010's. Throughout those years, I've encountered and always faced the problem of ass smelling computer chairs. For the record, I'm not fat.

I sit on my chair often and I've tried resolving the issue several ways.

1. I throw out the computer chair after 2 years.
2. I take 2 showers: Before work and during my break and use a lot of body wash down there.
3. I change my cloths 3 times a day.
4. I've tried changing my diet several times.
5. I've sprayed various types of cleaners and cleaned, but the ass odor always returns after a few days.

I suspect the issue is that I fart often throughout the day, especially while sitting down on my chair. I would also like to note that my farts do not result in sharts. I do have a healthy diet consistent of mostly protein.

- Traffics a Nightmare, Right? More folks working from home means fewer cars jamming up the roads. Less traffic equals fewer accidents and a smoother ride for everyone.
- Hunting for Parking Sucks: With less people driving to work, finding a parking spot wont feel like the Hunger Games.
- Delays Be Gone: buses on time more often thanks to less traffic 
- Breath of Fresh Air: With fewer cars on the road, were not just cutting down on noise pollution but also slashing the amount of noxious gases choking up our air. This means a significant bump in air quality, making those deep, city breaths a lot less toxic.
- Healthier, Happier Cities: Embracing remote work could mean not just cleaner air but also fewer sick days for all. With less crowding on public transport and in offices, we're giving contagious diseases fewer chances to spread.
- Local Love, Global Work: By rooting for remote work, we're supporting an economy where spending isn't confined to city centers. It's a shift that promises to rejuvenate neighborhood businesses, as remote workers distribute their dollars closer to home, breathing new life into local markets.

Bottom Line:

If you cant work from home, you should still be all for remote work. Less hassle getting to work, and quicker rides. Plus, driving without playing dodge-the-idiot? Priceless.

"2024-02-01",1706827721,"Employees are spending the equivalent of a months grocery bill on the return to the officeand growing more resentful than ever, new survey finds","https://archive.ph/KhMqO

Despite the benefits of remote work for employees, many organizations are abandoning it in favor of returning to the office full-timeor part-time in a hybrid model. A recent survey from BetterUp shows that the number of primarily remote roles has been cut in halfand one out of four organizations cite improved connection and culture as the business rationale behind mandated office returns.

However, our research found that returning to an office often is a major disruption to ones routine, foundational work, and overall life experience. We surveyed 1,400 full-time U.S. employees who were mandated to return to in-office work and found that they had higher burnout, stress, and turnover intentions. They also had lower trust in their organization, engagement, and productivity levels. Our results indicate that if the return-to-office transition is not handled with a high level of humanity, sensitivity, and empathy, workplace culture suffers, and the workforces sense of belonging plummets.

We also found that RTO results in pressure on employees flexibility, time, and even bank accounts. If you are struggling to adjust to a mandated return to the office, know that you are not alone. 

The main challenges of RTO

There are benefits that come from working in person. For example, research BetterUp has done in partnership with the University of California, Riverside found increased life satisfaction and social connectedness as benefits of in-person interaction over technology-mediated interaction. 

While it seems intuitive that people form better working relationships in person, poorly communicated and implemented return-to-office mandates breed resentment toward employers. Resentful employees are less likely to bring their authentic selves to the workplace and less likely to invest in those around them.
The most challenging aspect of returning to the office is the commute. This isnt surprising because commutes of only 30 minutes are linked to higher stress and anger, while 45 minutes or more is linked to poorer overall well-being, daily mood, and health. 

What is surprising is the second most challenging aspect of returning to work: the loss of flexibility to switch between work and home tasks for things like accepting a delivery or switching over the laundry between meetings. In a time-starved world, even the smallest time savings can be very important as people attempt to do it all. 

While some leaders might read this and think Ah-ha! I knew people were multi-tasking when they should be working!, the truth is, that remote work is actually a net gain for the organization. Research has found that people in remote work give more total hours to the company.  

With disruption comes opportunity

Evidence from BetterUp suggests agency in choice of work arrangement enables people to find a way of work that can optimize performance and well-being.

We also saw that an organizations decision to require in-office work represents a financial burden for employees. The average employee returning to the office spends $561 per month on transportation, additional child and pet care, and domestic assistance. That is comparable to the average two-person households grocery bill in the U.S. for the entire month.
So what can you do if your employer mandates your return-to-office? 

First, focus on maximizing the benefits of this life change, including the opportunity to deepen your relationships and collaborate more with your coworkers. Take advantage of the hybrid work model to connect with the people who are physically there as much as possible (rather than only logging on to virtual meetings).

Second, consider if returning to the office represents an opportunity for better work-life balance. If you are back in the office full-time, can you embrace leaving work at work? Can you create desirable new habits or routines like going to the gym on your way in each day? Shifting back into in-person work is a major systemic disruption, but with that disruption comes the opportunity to design healthier habits.

Finally, ask for what you need to thrive while returning to the office. Do you need a late start so you can continue to drop your kids off at school? Do you need better commuter benefits to offset financial costs? Do you need a coach to support you as you make the transition back to the office? Thoughtfully raise these needs with your manager.

Return-to-office mandates can affect employees and not necessarily in the ways that leaders are hoping. If you are in a situation where you are being asked to dramatically shift your way of working, know that its normal to find this transition difficult, to have a mix of emotions about it, and most importantly, that its never wrong to ask for what you need.

"2023-08-07",1691424550,"Amazon's Stealthy Layoffs","If you haven't been following along the past few weeks. Amazon was 100% WFH during the pandemic. They did mass layoffs earlier in the year in their corporate offices. Estimates are over 30,000 people and many more have quit. Then they forced workers to come to an office 3 days a week. (Here in Seattle it absolutely caused traffic to spiral out of control in a matter of days). Now they are telling employees that everyone that works for corporate needs to report to an office 3 days a week even if they were hired as a remote employee. Relocate or Resign is the motto. This is clearly stealth layoffs and many other companies are going to try the same tactic as the economy slows and companies don't want to pay unemployment.

There is a great article in the Seattle Times today about all of this. These decisions will have long lasting impacts on morale and the ability to hire future employees.

Excerpt: 

*""The policy lands like a one-two punch for employees. They are caught off guard by the sudden change, and then face a Hobsons choice  a choice where only one option is realistically feasible. They are either forced to disrupt their lives and relocate or hand in their resignation, creating an environment akin to an ambush and leading to a lose-lose situation that leaves no winners.*

*The fallout from such a policy can be devastating to team morale and corporate culture  two cornerstones of any organizations success. Forcing employees to relocate can severely destabilize team morale, similar to a gust of wind sweeping through a delicately constructed house of cards. Employees, feeling like expendable pawns in a grand corporate chess game, face an enormous emotional strain having to choose between their job and their home. This can lead to a significant drop in morale, causing a domino effect throughout the organization.""*

There was times I was fully remote during covid so i got a feel of what it was like and the sleep was great. I used to rush to be in at 8-8:30 in the office (we had daily meetings at 8 which was hell. If I was running late Id take it over the phone but having it so early shouldve been illegal). Starting early is one thing but needing to do the status update and small talk shit so early sucked on top of everything else. 

Now, I can log on between 8 and 8:30, make a coffee sometime before 9 and also a quick breakfast. Before Id be scrambling to pick up a greasy breakfast sandwich or rush to buy a coffee , unless my sweet bf had made breakfast / coffee for me because I just suck at waking up early enough to do all that, plus get ready to be in at 8 am. 

Its only a few weeks of me being remote and already, my cortisol levels have adapted to not needing to be in a massive rush as soon as I get up. I wash my face or shower, get changed, log on, check my emails and a few other things, and then get my breakfast and coffee made and sit at my desk again in peace and quiet. No more how was your weekend chats the minute I clock into work. We still have touch point meetings but they are later on and by then Im usually more awake; being fully remote I like having these too as it gives me a chance to ask questions and touch base with people I may not otherwise talk to in the day. Its so much more useful having a daily touch point when youre remote as most of the time it felt painful and pointless in the office . 

Its been an absolute game changer for me to not feel a huge sense of dread the second I wake up, first because in the office I get way more social interaction than I want and need from coworkers, second, because I suck at waking up early and know I will be practically bolting out the door, hungry and tired much of the time.

Management here doubled down and insisted that there would be no remote work at all. The lead told everyone that work from home would only be allowed for excused absences (sick kid, waiting on cable guy, etc.). They made clear that no one would have regular WFH days. 

In November my manager pulled me aside and told me to stop talking about WFH. Told me point blank that it wouldn't happen, and that team members would be disciplined if they kept discussing it with one another. So I stopped talking about WFH...and started looking for remote jobs. 

Today I got an offer! It's about 15% higher salary with better benefits, and 100% remote. In the interview I asked about the likelihood of return to office.

I have a coworker, ""Judy"" who had children earlier in life, so while she and I are the same age, hers are adults and my son is 5. She has a role similar to mine on the same team, and mostly similiar to another coworker, ""Tina"" who also has young kids and a family member she helps take to medical appointments. Judy lives roughly 2o minutes from the office, Tina and I both live over an hour away and have to drop off and pick up our kids from school, or have someone else do it. 

When the pandemic started our team switched to all WFH. Then it was WFH except for having to come in once in a while. Then a monthly project was introduced that we were responsible for and it can only be done in the office (literally there is no way to complete it outside of it due to specialized equipment we can't have at home). Judy and I would work on it, sometimes togther, sometimes not. It takes two people two days each to do it. Tina was not working on it as she did other work for the team that we didn't have to do, it was balanced and worked out. 

Then our bosses decided that we have to come in every other week for one day a week. Due to the deadline of this project, that would mean coming in three days if only Judy and I worked on the project. I suggested that we could split up the work then between the three of us. One month Tina and I would work together on part of the project and I could help her with her other work, and the next month Judy and Tina could work togehter and Judy would help Tina with her work. Judy balked at the idea, said we should just do our own work. She also said she were trying to get out of coming into the office three days a month which is true, and then she tried to say the bosses required us to come up two days for this special project in addition to one day every other week, which is definitely not true - I confirmed with my boss that if we could do our part of the work in one office day (which we could do with any combination of us working together), that was fine.

Judy has been saying for months that she thinks we all (but especially those of us in this role) should be in the office more. She's gone so far as to say repeatedly in meetings with bosses that she feels whenever anyone's boss or anyone they are supporting is in the office, she thinks they shoudl be, too.

I would like to eventually move to a lower dose of medication, and maybe even have one less pill to take. I've been walking around my neighborhood more while the weather is still decent too.

The only downside is that I make about the same with my full time position as I did with freelancing, but having the reduced stress, as well as less wear and tear on the car is a major plus. Plus the health benefits and 401K. I still do some freelance work on weekends, but for now my focus is building a better work/life balance and routine.

I hope that in a few years, I'll make enough money so that I don't have to take freelancing gigs on the weekend. And one things for sure, I'm never stepping foot and commuting to an office again. It's so nice that I can relax on my couch for a few minutes in between tasks.","WFH",26,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/1fpg0hn/unexpected_health_benefit_of_wfh/"

Traveling and flying was mostly fun but hectic, and I liked meeting my coworkers in person. However  the amount of gossiping and talking behind others' backs was astounding. 

I tried not to engage in these types of conversations. I barely got any work done since people were constantly walking around me, although grantedly, we had a lot of meetings on our agendas. There were also people coughing left and right.

Like to the extent that over time, I could see one lifestyle over the other leading to added/subtracted years of life.

WFH days, my sleep score is better (because I dont have to wake up 1.5+ hrs earlier to put on work clothes/makeup and drive to my office). My steps are WAY better (usually 6-8 miles a day vs 3 in the winter if Im lucky). At home, I do an AM dog park/walk, lunchtime walk, and looong walk with my dog right when work ends. We usually wind through one of the gorgeous forest paths near our house, which is restorative and de-stressing. Ive got plenty of time after that to squeeze in a Peloton or Les Mills exercise class, and I dont feel guilty about doing it because my dog is tired and happy. 

Office days: I leave the house in the dark, to work in a basement with zero natural light. I have to use a happy light to stave off depression, and I get frequent headaches from the fluorescent overhead bulbs. I barely leave my desk and get minimal steps because the only walking options are to do laps in the surrounding parking lot (which is ugly and depressing), and I get home with maybe 15 mins before dark if Im lucky. Its cold and not particularly safe to do the long walks my dog and I love at that point. Oh, and unless I make the time to pack a breakfast and lunch, I end up eating out for both meals. I get home hungry and exhausted and feel guilty if I dont squeeze in a workout because Ive done nothing but sit in a cubicle all day.

Husband texts me and says they have to evacuate the building. When he arrives home, he tells me that a there was structural damage inside the building, and a load bearing wall was about to collapse. Apparently even the fire marshal was involved and ordered the office to be shut down. A company-wide email is sent out shortly after declaring everyone is fully remote until further notice.

Ive been working from home 2 years now and still getting used to the differences from my past job. I used to teach and now do mostly solitary work, and I tend to take my mistakes way too hard. Back when I was teaching, little errors were easy to brush off. I could normally rectify the issues quick and could see the persons face/body language that it wasnt a big deal. Overall I seem to struggle with doing this affirming on my own. I feel like this makes me sound like I was fucking up constantly, but I wasnt I swear! Just being human and having minor slips. Also I feel like I somehow made fewer mistakes during the intensity of teaching&

I just made a mistake at work today and am feeling an insane amount of cringe and embarrassment: I saw the pop up of a chat where a teammate said they could meet on a Wednesday. I used the outlook scheduling assistant to find an opening for everyone that day and sent it out. Then I saw in the full chat with window that they said Wednesday afternoon. I was confused because I could have sworn their calendar was booked during that time but assumed I had been confused since there were like 6 calendars in the mix. I pinged them and asked if I could schedule something for a grayed out time on their calendar, and kept staring at the scheduling assistant feeling like I was going crazy. I finally realized I had been looking at THE WRONG DAY all along. I pinged them again and explained my error briefly, but they said the invite had been out too long and not to change it. 

Granted, everyone can make the meeting. It was scheduled during an open time. But I feel like a complete moron for making this mistake. I start questioning my sanity like how was I staring at this thing and not realizing I had the wrong day up? 

Does anyone else make mistakes while working from home and struggle with handling it? Its so hard when I dont see my coworkers faces often&.and I feel so intensely embarrassed that I slipped up. If anyone can affirm or offer advice it would be super appreciated. Thank you!!

"2023-08-20",1692539856,"I really wish hybrid jobs would be more upfront about what they mean by hybrid...","Generally, unless I'm told otherwise, if a job is described as 'hybrid' I'm going to assume it's 2 or 3 days per week in office then remainder at home. But I've seen jobs described as hybrid which are less than this (1 day a week, maybe even just 1 day a month) or more, sometimes essentially being a full time office role with rare occasions of WFH as a 'perk'.

And I get that any mix of office and remote is technically hybrid so none of these are inaccurate, but would it be so difficult for job ads to have a brief section laying out what their expectations are?

Whether that's 'we want you in on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday no questions asked' or  'we'd like you in once or twice a week but don't particularly care which days they are' or 'just come into office or work from home as you please, just get the work done' or any of the other thousands of permutations there are. But all of these mean *very* different things from a work-life balance perspective. 

Not being clear from the outset achieves nothing but wasting everyone's time.

E.g. If someone needs to have Wednesdays WFH  let's say for childcare related reasons, and only after the application and interview stages are told 'you have to be in on Wednesdays' with no flexibility... said person who previously thought they could take the job now knows they can't and has wasted time effort and money in applying. The company has likewise wasted time and effort they needn't have if they'd just been clear about their expectations.

1. Mail.  Somebody has to show up to go through all the mail and dole it out where it needs to go.  The office receptionist left during covid and a handful of employees took up that mantle, but since, we've trained a dozen or so on the procedure.  In theory, we could get down to 1-2 days a month.

2. Training.  As the primary person responsible for training in my department, it can be done on line, but it is orders of magnitude more efficient face-to-face.  

My biggest problem with RTO is that nobody can give me a rational productivity reason why going into the office is superior to me being at home.  Or honestly even equal to WFH, from a productiviy standpoint.

I have no problem going in to train a new hire, or to process the mail if it's my day in the barrel.

My commute is walking downstairs to my office. But at this late hour, my mind wanders and wanders wide. I think how this is a very peculiar and special time for our species. 

Ever since the creation of automobiles and modern cities, with office buildings and commerce, highways, and all that jazz...basically this current iteration of contemporary life in big cities, we've been stuck in this mode of office work. Generations have come and gone doing it. You go to work, you sit there for so many hours, you go home, and then you do it all over again five soul-sapping days out of the week. 

And then 'boom'...I mean KA-BOOM. Pandemic. Everyone's sent home and we go on this big, world-fucking-wide social experiment called work from home. Could only work in this day and age. No one knows how the hell it's going to go. But two years in, the consensus is it's going fuckin' great. Company managers love it, employees love it, no hit on ""productivity"". Employee morale and satisfaction is A+. 

But as covids subsides, gets less serious, there are whispers, rumors, murmurings and then you get the memo...the office is reopening (read: RTO), if you weren't one of the lucky ones where the company had the sense to forego renewing the lease on the office because it didn't make fiscal sense to keep an empty office building, employees were happier WFH, and company goals were met or exceeded despite not having a single in-person meeting all year. 

Fast forward to 2023. You have media hit pieces on WFH. Op-ed pieces masquerading as journalism, still questioning if WFH is the future (hint: the future is now). And then you have these billionaire CEO assholes saying, ""No, no, no...WFH is bad for everyone, bad for economy, productivity."" This Elon Musk jergoff questioning the morality of it when he has no grasp on the reality of how the vast majority of middle-class Americans experience life, day in and day out.

The drumbeats of RTO are getting louder and louder every day, but it's more than that. It's signalling a threat to millions of human souls of misery to come. You may say I'm being dramatic, but once you've not only seen what is possible, but have lived it, you can't go back. It's like a bird freed from their cage, experiencing unfettered freedom, just to be locked up again. 

I want to put things in perspective for all of you. Working from home and all that it encompasses has arguably been the biggest, most transformative change to how modern humans do work in the last century. It was inevitable that we would get to this point and the pandemic ushered in this era. We are living in this era now. 

I call it an era, but the powers that be would rather call it an inconvenience, an unfortunate side-effect that they are trying to currently undo. We all saw what happened in early 2020. In my city, for the first time ever on Monday morning, I could see the skyline miles deep. The air was clear, my mind was clear and my eyes were wide fucking open. And they still are. 

To put this all further into perspective, we are in a struggle on behalf of all humans in the future (your children and their children) who may very well do work on a computer, over the internet, or whatever future computer contraptions we come up with - maybe some version of an Apple Vision Pro? 

It is a struggle for how we will ultimately define our species going forward: shortsighted, profit-driven, everythingincluding our health, the health of our planetbe damned. Or, humane, human-centric, eco-minded.

I once thought Elon Musk embodied the latter qualities, but turns out he's all about the former. (I don't have a grudge against the guy, really. But he is a hypocrite and a goddamn influential one). It's hard not to see him and his ilk, and all companies unnecessarily calling for workers to RTO as the biggest threat to the world we (the workers) want to build and keep.

What I hope is that as you read this (and thank you for making it this far into my late night musing) you'll think about how you, as an individual, will change the conversation around WFH so that WFH is no longer WFH, but is just work. After all, what makes our culture, is an endless conversation and exchange of ideas and building consensus.

However I just had an interview and they had the nerve to call it a Hybrid position when it was 1 day working from home. Lol

I kind of felt that they wanted to lowball me too because they asked me 3x what my salary expectations were and kept saying.. so you said you were looking for insert lowest number in the range. 

Im essentially asking for $20k more but now that I think about it, even that wouldnt get me into the office. It would have to be $25-30k more. Especially for only 1 day at home. 

Im open to a hybrid situation but they have to compensate me fairly. Especially for the pain and suffering of driving to work everyday and all the other expenses that go along with that. Oh yea.. and inflation. 

So I ask, what would get you back in? If at all.

After going into the office and being ""available in person"" for HR and the few people that will be going into the office regularly. I'd like to share some details about this wonderful experience I have been going through. /s

First off, my HR department is completely unchecked, and they have the mindset of ""our way or the highway"" so any pushback I give, they go directly to my higherups to complain about me. Which lucky for me, my higherups have my back since IT doesnt report to HR, and IT has a standard process for everything. I hate how under a microscope I feel as of recently

Second, I commute into the office, buy my lunch, and leave my dog home in his crate for 6-9 hrs a day to sit in my IT closet and do the same work I do at home, and maybe talk to 1-2 people a day. Which these interactions can 100% be resolved remotely with proper planning. ""we need this conference room setup for a meeting this afternoon, it hasnt been working for a while"" , Then tell me about it sooner than the morning of the meeting.

I used to go in probably once ever 2 weeks for 1-2 hrs with a checklist of things to complete, then I'd leave again and finish my day from home. 

I work very well with clear goals and little super vision, and my higherups (who all work remotely throughout the US and India) know this and like my performance. But this local HR team is beginning to be too much for me to deal with. I can do things how I want, and it's negatively impacting my work.

The confusing thing about the whole situation is that before I left for my 2 week vacation I was told, unofficially(but from someone who should be correct on these details) that we were looking to downsize office spaces and move to a more remote work style to cut down on office space. Then the day after I get back from my trip, I'm hit with the ""why arent you in the office?"" LOL like cmon guys use your brains here.

(https://www.wsj.com/articles/remote-work-from-home-boss-d093a36c)

&gt; In a survey of 13,000 office workers in six countries published this month, McKinsey found the largest share of employees who strongly prefer to work from home were those who earn more than $150,000.

And 

&gt; The survey also showed 44% of the most senior workers are holding fast to their work-from-home preferencesevidence that continued flexibility remains a lure for attracting and retaining top performers.

Theres been this assumption that RTO is being pushed by bosses and senior folks. But if 44% of senior people would rather go hybrid or WFH (or leave) it means RTO beyond hybrid is going to be pretty unworkable.

"2023-09-06",1694023296,"WFH Thoughts","Two thoughts in my brain recently about WFH. 

1 - Modern life is BUSY. 

Modern life includes all sorts of minutiae like calling the insurance company and fixing door hinges and booking the kids dentist appointments. Most households now have all adults working full-time to make ends meet, so all this minutiae gets shoehorned into evenings and weekends. 

WFH gives us back a tiny shred of balance; we can get the laundry turned over at noon instead of starting it at 7pm. We can log off at 5pm and start dinner at 5:10 instead of starting at 6pm. Time spent commuting becomes time for everything else in life. Letting the dishwasher repair guy in, then handing him a credit card when hes done, becomes a 10 minute thing instead of burning through a whole day of PTO. 

Ive been thinking a lot about how in the traditional family with a stay-at-home partner (usually the wife), Dad worked 40 hours at work while Mom worked 30-40 hours on the kids and house. Now? The parents work 80 hours between the two of them, then you add those 30-40 hours of domestic minutiae. Families are now working 110-120 hours a week. Were hanging on to WFH with all our might partly because those reclaimed hours are a game changer. 

2 - People who say remote teams cant collaborate are cut from a certain personality cloth. 

Theyre generally extroverts - and crucially, theyre people who dont communicate well in writing. Email and instant messaging tools dont work for them. (I have one colleague whose emails always require a bit of head scratching and translating what was actually meant). 

Meanwhile, Im an introvert who communicates best in writing. More than 10 years ago, I was part of an online forum; we collaborated on a massive book project which included submissions from hundreds of people around the planet. It was awesome, and built such a camaraderie that I still talk to some of those people nearly daily. 

On the flip side, my last pre-pandemic job was fully on-site. My only contact with those colleagues now is in the occasional social media like. For people like me (and I think Reddit naturally selects such types), remote work is the best thing that could have happened.

My internship was fully remote, the campus job I had in a research lab allowed me to do all of my work remotely (I didn't interact with the human subjects, I was just the data manager), and when I started this job in January after graduation everyone was fully remote with the option to come in to the (very, very nice) office if anyone preferred that.

Wondering is anyone else is experiencing the same? 

My first position was for a Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) helping out with rejected pharmacy claims. The work was great, but management required everyone to come back to office and I had an accommodation to continue to wfh and they quickly put me on a PIP to get me out of their. I loved the work since I was a pharmacy tech prior and got to see how claims got resolved. 

Second position was for Short Term Disability claims and the workload expected was unreal, which ultimately lead to a mental breakdown and me ending up on short term disability myself. 

Third and current position is a help desk for truckers gps/engine analytic devices and the work is fine but most my coworkers are unhelpful, rude, and lazy. Im trying to learn as much as I can but I just get snarky remarks and coworkers telling my I should know these complex processes when Im still just getting out of training. 

Am at a loss. All Ive really done prior to wfh was customer service (pharm tech, retail, teacher for kids on the spectrum, warehouse tech) and I cant comprehend if its a me problem or something else. 

Currently thinking of going back onsite and trying to get out of forward facing customer service. Maybe an apprenticeship might be good so I can pick up a new skill with a new environment. 

I love the idea of wfh and hope all you continue enjoying what you do, but would like to know if anyone else is experiencing similar issues?

Theyre in a fairly rural area and as a result have a hard time finding people with experience that they can put into more senior roles like mine. 

I work a lot with our customers and the products I manage represent about $200M in revenue. A large part of that business is due to the relationships Ive developed with our customers. They definitely have other options. 

Anyway, I was 100% WFH all through Covid and through the experience, I came to a few realizations. Mainly that I hated the commute, an hour each way. I live in a small city and commute out to the boonies for work. 

So, when we started going back to the office, I wasnt really happy about it, but in my case, it was only 1 day/week, and thats probably reasonable for my job. Then it was 3 days in office but only if you filled out a form and justified it. A couple of months ago, they announced that we were all going back to full RTO, 5 days/week. I tried to protest, but despite data to the contrary my boss, his boss and on up the chain firmly believe the Were more productive IN the office! BS. 

Theyre having a hard time hiring. Candidates will ask in the phone screen, Is this position remote or hybrid? and as soon as they hear, No, were in the office 5days/week., 90% of the candidates will say, Im not interested then. Needless to say, this means there are a lot of open positions. 

Retention is declining slowly, but its mostly among people with just a couple of YOE and its easier to spread the workload around to the other employees doing the same work. 

Ive tried giving feedback to management that I was not happy with RTO, but they were not listening. So about 2-3 months ago I started looking elsewhere, just casually at first, but almost immediately, I started getting interviews and then an offer at a company that is about 10 minutes away. Much better pay, better benefits, more vacation and best of all theres pretty much a Come in to the office if you need/want to otherwise WFH. Theyre also paying for a nice sit/stand desk and a chair to use at home. Offer accepted!

I type up my notice letter, print 3 copies. Its just the basic three sentences. (Thank you for the opportunities, Its time to move on and this date will be my last day) One copy for my boss, one for his boss and one for HR. The HR copy I drop in their mailbox and the other two, I leave in their respective offices on their keyboards. Then I go about my day.

The next morning, Im greeted by my boss and his boss both of whom are wearing a scowling version of the surprised Pikachu face. They ask me why. I tell them I havent been happy for a while and if they have to ask, they havent been paying attention. 

They make a counteroffer, I decline. They make a better one, I decline again. They ask me what they can do to get me to stay. Finally, I tell them that theres nothing to be done about it at this point, the time to act was all of those times I asked to WFH whenever possible and was denied. Repeatedly. They werent happy about the breakup, but they made their bed, let them lie in it. 

During my transition, I tried to wrap things up as best I could and lay out the immediate needs for each project and I informed my customers. 

I dont know exactly what the fallout from my departure was, but one of my former colleagues did tell me that its been a complete shitshow.

"2023-10-29",1698542578,"I stopped coming into the office and& nothing happened","Well theres actually some context but thats the gist.

Long story short, I work for a very large company. Several thousand employees all across the country. I was 100% in office for years, including any OT. Then in March 2020 they told us to stop coming into the office& and work went on. Everybody got their jobs done from home.

Then RTO happened in March 2022, three days a week. Then they went to 4 days a week a few months ago. It sucked. I have a nice home office. My chair is more comfortable. I have windows and sunlight. My monitors are much bigger. I can have music or videos in the background, and I am soooo much more productive at home. But I only worked from home one day a week, plus OT. So in total, up to 30 hours a week from home, and 32 hours in office. Not bad.

But sometime in December I started to get headaches on days I was in the office. They really started to affect my work performance. I didnt realize how bad it got until I went on vacation for 2 weeks and felt better. It was like waking up from a dream. So when I got back, I went to the doctor and asked them to write me out. They did for two weeks.

It took a few days for my headache to go away. And then I was free. But heres the crazy part. I sent the medical accommodation to HR, and they said theyll review and approve it. And they just never got back to me! I followed up daily until they said they have a committee that meets once a week to approve these requests. And I guess they just havent been meeting? When my two weeks were up, I got another note for a month. Submitted that one and again, zero movement. My plan is to get them for three months at a time going forward.

So officially, I am cleared to WFH until the committee approves me working from home. Bureaucracy at its finest! So technically, I am not approved to WFH, but I gave my management an excuse and stopped showing up. Nobody is questioning it. Honestly I could have made something up and nobody would care. I just got lost in the cracks. Wild.

The affects of being back at home are massive. Ive lost about 15 pounds this month. Im eating better, I have time to take long walks. My relationship with my wife improved. I get to play with the kids. Im sleeping much better as well, and without meds! Almost no snoring which makes my wife happy. And most importantly, I havent had a headache in almost a month.

It's like it's so easy to set boundaries, you can keep your margins razor thin end enjoy life right up to the moment you sit down in your home office.

That got us discussing all the different ways working from home can benefit your health. We came up with a lot, but I'm curious which other ways people have found WFH benefits their overall health.

Besides WFH being great for socialization and work/life balance, it's a great way to eat better which leads to feeling a lot better. And it's much easier to make time to exercise or just take a nice walk outside.

Finally, WFH has been a huge improvement to my work-time ergonomics. We have an ergonomics specialist on staff who meets with remote employees to ensure they've got a healthy &amp; comfortable set up. It's really made a big difference to be able to make my working environment perfect for me.

My company also used to have a very good WFH program, that I was part of for several years. I never had any issues at all with productivity or attendance. That program got shuttered a few years before Covid hit, so I worked from the office in the afternoons a few days a week, and still did the bulk of my work from home. When the lockdowns hit in March of 2020, I was still mostly WFH, so it was an easy transition for me to WFH full time again. I just kept on keeping on, and still had no performance issues.

But now we're being told we have to return to the office 2-3 days a week. And, not surprisingly, I keep getting notifications that someone in the building has tested positive for the coronavirus. So I've decided I'm not going to go, at least not really.

They track how often we enter the building by scanning badges at the door, so I will scan my badge to get my ID in the log, and then I will turn around an go straight home again.

Commuting:
1. Gas - I would commute 13 miles one way to my previous role downtown. Since gas is roughly $5 a gallon where I live and my car gets 30 miles to a gallon then I would be spending $4.33 a day to commute. 

2. Car maintenance - lets say with the extra amount of driving to and from the office causes additional wear and tear on my vehicle then I would be spending an additional $300 a year or $1.25 a day to maintain it. 

3. Time sitting in traffic - I make roughly $80 an hour in my role and if it took 1.5 hours a day to drive to and from work then it would be worth $120 dollars a day to sit in traffic. I could be using that time being productive in my role at home. 

The cost of commuting for me: $125.58/day or $32,650.80 a year. 

4. Clothing costs - I dont have to have a professional wardrobe unless Im flying to the corporate office. Id say I would spend roughly $600 a year on professional clothes. 

5. Flexibility - the ability to run errands during the day, intercepting packages, meeting contractors to do work on the house and being able to pick up my children during the day without a big interruption in my work is the best perk for me. It is hard to quantify but if I  had to put a dollar amount on this then I would say its worth $10 a day or $2600 a year for me. 

Just with these considerations alone, I would need to have a pay raise of $35,850.80 not including a percentage increase in my salary to consider jumping ship to an in office position. ","WFH",654,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/1c6i9po/if_you_had_to_put_a_dollar_amount_to_it_how_much/"

At some point, I turned back to my computers and started working and was answering a question in Teams from my boss.

My husband popped in to ask me a question on the way out the door but I didnt hear him because I was focused on this work convo. He then became frustrated I wasnt listening and was distracted and I had to remind him Im at WORK. He leaves frustrated and its an annoying start to the day.

My husbands great and its not a big deal but just a uniquely work from home problem and I cant be the only one.

Whats the dumbest conflict youve had with a partner because of WFH?

Edit to share a few thoughts: 

1. This is a work from home issue because if I was in the office, my husband would call me if he had a question and I would have the opportunity to answer the call, send a text saying call you in 5, or reject the call and call back in a few minutes. And there would be no frustration as a result. There is no presumption of availability when one is working in the office as there can often be at home.

2. Your responses were illuminating. I see a lot of people suggesting that family always comes before work. Which I agree with! But it's interesting to see there seems to be two versions of what this looks like. One group believes ""family first"" means no matter the task, your family can interrupt you at any given moment because they are more important.

I personally believe that ""family first"" means my husband and I put one another first, before ourselves. This means respecting that we both have careers, that no - are not the most important job in the world - but are important to us, so we respect and support each other in those respective careers. Of course if it was an emergency or an urgent question, I would drop everything. But there is also an element of both of us assessing the urgency of the task, then asking permission to engage with the other (ie. ""do you have a moment?""). This communicates respect and rejects a sense of entitlement that we ""owe"" each other our attention. 

3. To clarify, I did not hear my husband and purposefully ignore him. When I am really focused on a task or conversation, it's difficult for me to hear things happening around me. ","WFH",491,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/1doly7o/tell_me_im_not_the_only_one/"

I started a new job in August 2021 that was fully remote at that point due to COVID, with the idea that wed move to a hybrid model in time. After 8 months, we moved to two days a week on-site. This was great for about another 8-9 months. 

At that point my partner and I were starting to talk about moving in together. He owns his place, I rented, so it made sense to move into his place. Id been renting an apartment a five minute drive from my office; his place is a 35 min to 45 min drive, but I figured I could deal with it twice a week. 

In February, we were told we needed to start coming in 4x a week because reasons. (There is zero business case that anyone has been able to convey. It appears the real reason is - surprise, surprise - to justify commercial office space). 

Ive just finished moving in with my partner, and wow, did I underestimate how much a 45 minute drive to work SUCKS after having not done any meaningful commuting since Feb 2020. I get so much less sleep now that I have to deal with shower/hair/makeup/commute before getting my day started. In the evening, Im so much more exhausted after work. 

Im an individual contributor, so by design I need to ignore other people in order to do my work. My work doesnt lend itself to collaboration. The only collaborating that happens is my small team sitting around venting to each other about how utterly pointless it is to be on-site.

On top of this, my company is doing renovations to our office space. I was told with just a few hours notice last month that I had to pack up everything and move to a new cubicle to make way for construction work. No one told IT, and my new cubicle wasnt wired for Ethernet (and the wifi constantly drops). Its been a month and still no Ethernet.

"2024-03-28",1711629475,"Remote jobs are up 10% from a year ago and 31% 6 months ago","Is remote work dead or here to stay? I analyzed 1M remote job openings in the past year to find out. Here's what I learned..

1) Remote jobs are making a comeback

The % of new jobs that were listed as remote is up 10% year over year, and 31% from a year ago. After a decline for more than a year, remote jobs have been on an uptrend.

2) Senior level jobs are more likely to be remote than mid-level and entry-level jobs

5.35% of senior-level jobs were remote in the past year, compared to 4.9% for mid-level and 2.48% for entry level. 

Remote work is a privilege that must be earned and companies seem to trust experienced professionals more with that privilege

3) Director and VP jobs were more likely to be remote than individual contributor jobs

This one surprised me a bit as we've heard the stories on how senior executives want employees back in the office. 

But the data tells a different story. Companies are more likely to hire VP and Directors remotely than lower level workers. This was true even in the tech sector, among both big companies and startups.

4) Preferences for remote work differ drastically by profession and industry

Engineers and tech workers vastly prefer working remotely. In fact, the large majority prefer 5 days a week of remote work.

When I polled my Twitter followers (who primarily work in the financial industry), they all preferred a hybrid environment, and a fair share even preferred working 1-2 days at home a week.

5) Salaries for remote jobs are essentially the same as non-remote jobs

I compared the average salary of jobs that were remote to those that were non-remote for the same job title. There was essentially no difference between the two.

6) Remote jobs from US-based companies have stayed mostly within the US.

Whether it's because of legal or logistical reasons, most remote jobs from US-based companies have remained in the US, and that trend has been fairly consistent the past 4-5 years. 

I also analyzed which countries have the highest % of remote jobs, which job titles are most likely to be remote, and whether theres a correlation between remote work and work satisfaction.

Ive still only been going two days a week at most. I wont do 3.  Id prefer to never be onsite. The work I do doesnt require it 90% of the time.

And everyone just sits there awkwardly because no, it's not that tricky. Maybe it was at first, but we've had almost half a decade to figure it out.

Its getting harder to find a remote job in the U.S., but you might have better luck working from home for a company based abroad.

The number of American workers hired by international companies grew 62% last year, according to the State of Global Hiring Report from Deel, an HR platform that specializes in global hiring.

The report is based on 300,000 contracts between Deel customers and workers for both contractors and full-time employees, and roughly 85% of those contracts are for remote positions.

American workers are most likely to be hired by companies in the U.K., Canada, France, Singapore and Australia.

The spike in U.S. workers vying for remote jobs headquartered overseas feels correlated with the elimination of remote roles stateside, says Deel CEO Alex Bouaziz. He knows from experience people are quitting jobs with return-to-office requirements to be remote: A couple of our competitors did that, and we hired their best people. So I welcome them to keep doing it.

Workers with unique, in-demand skills being hired internationally

Global employers want to tap into the U.S. talent market because its so large and has produced some of the most influential companies in the world, Bouaziz says. International bosses want to leverage more U.S. talent to bring some of that culture that leads to the biggest enterprises in the world to their home country.

Americans who work remotely for international employers tend to live in San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Austin and Miami. These U.S. economic powerhouses are a playground to hire highly knowledgeable workers with unique skills in product, growth and sales, Bouaziz says. Some of the most common jobs are in research, sales, software engineering, content and product.

A lot of those companies are thinking, How do we build the right playbook that theyve done in the U.S.? Bouaziz adds. One way is to bring U.S. workers to their companies.

By age, roughly half of American workers with contracts via Deel are between 25 and 34 years old; 18% are between 35 and 44, while 25% are 45 years or older.

The upsides and downsides

Working remotely for an internationally company isnt as straightforward as simply working from home.

Aside from figuring out taxes and other HR compliance issues, Bouaziz says its important to consider differences in time zones. A Californian working for a company based in Europe may have to adjust to early hours.

A lot also rides on how the companys distributed workforce is set up: Are you the only American employed by a company abroad, or are you part of a larger group stateside? Do you work from home, or will you go into a satellite office? Does your whole team work the same hours, or do you overlap for part of the day and rely on asynchronous work for the other?

Then, cultural differences come into play from the small things (like holiday time off) to the big (communication norms). Jumping cultures can be quite intense, Bouaziz says. Its something you need to be malleable for. Its not hard, but you do need to understand and accept norms  to make everyone comfortable and do their best work while being considerate.

That being said, accepting the norms of a different countrys work culture can also be a big plus. You may enjoy a different style of communication or perspective on work-life balance.

At first I was kind of excited to get some interaction and meet everyone...but it has turned my formerly positive view of the company and management into pure disgust..

There is NO ""culture"" there. We don't interact with anyone on our own team hardly, let alone others. The managers walk around all smug and like they own the place without having any involvement on the floor. My manager regularly is watching YouTube and gets mad when anyone tries to get her attention for help or to ask a question (too busy playing games, watching YouTube, or listening to music; how dare we bother her with work!)...they have one microwave for 50 people and so it's either bring cold lunch, pay a ton for eating out, or wait for 30-45 minutes to use the microwave then have to scarf down your meal.. They offer the cheapest, most crappy snacks (generic granola bars and chips) but recently upper management sent out an email telling people to keep tgr snack limit at 3 per day and no more (""otherwise may have to rethink offering this benefit"")...I ABSOLUTELY HATE it!! I've lost all respect for the company, my immediate managers, and especially upper management. I get to spend time and $$ commuting in order to secure their tax breaks and do 3x the work for far less pay than even my immediate, useless manager.

I'm applying elsewhere, but honestly, my morale and mental health have taken a nosedive and I'm on the verge of quitting with no backup. I know that is stupid and not a good idea, but i have become so anxious and depressed (already have a history of bipolar disorder and severe generalized anxiety disorder)...

My manager who took over the role a year and change ago,  started asking those of us within her city range to come into the office once a month for a department wide meeting six months ago.

All good....or so i thought.  What's once a month?  Well found out from a colleague who lives near me that the manager changed that employees work location to NYC from the suburbs ...and wanted to change mine also to Nyc.

That would trigger an automatic 4% tax in our wages for NYC commuter tax.

My colleague found out from our team lead,  Who slipped it  that the ultimate plan was to then move the 4 of us who lived within 90 miles of NYc  from a team of 30 to come back to the office at first once a month...then once a week...then twice a week to ease us into full time in office.

That would cost 6 grand a year in commuting costs plus 3 grand plus a year in taxes, not to mention 4 hours round trip daily commute.

Why did they want this? Because they wanted to manage the 4 of us directly.  Stupidity as for the last 3 years we were 100% remote with no issues.

My colleague opened an Hr case and brought it to the highest levels of management how 4 of us because of proximity to Nyc were being treated in a disparate, inequitable, and discriminatory  manner (we are all over 40 vs rest of team 30 yr old average age).......and won.

Now all monthly in office meetings are cancelled as due to HR rules, we would have to be re imbursed the $ 50 a day commuting cost and the 3 hours of commute time either paid as overtime or included in our daily hours.

The car behind me realized he wouldnt be able to stop in time and tried to swerve out of the lane. He still hit me and sideswiped the vehicle in that lane right off the road. An hour later the state patrolman arrived, and 30 minutes later I made it to the office.

Overall it was just a minor accident, nobody was injured and I only suffered minor damage to my vehicle. In addition to arriving at the office 80 minutes later than I would have, I spent an hour filing a claim and talking to my insurance company and another 45 minutes filing a claim with his insurance company, plus we have to take the car to their office to get an estimate, and eventually after the claims go through we will lose access to our car for a few days while it gets repaired.","WFH",53,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/187qvf7/yesterday_i_was_reminded_of_why_i_work_from_home/"

There's a dude who works in our team who has mentioned he prefers to work in office. I've seen the quality of his work and it's basically shit. He's a good looking dude and looks tall (never met him in person ) and gives off the impression that he gets by with doing as little work as possible and his appearance.

 It just occurred to me that he might bethr one in a senior role and not me if we were in an office environment. Height and appearance do play a role in people's perception.

At some point, I turned back to my computers and started working and was answering a question in Teams from my boss.

My husband popped in to ask me a question on the way out the door but I didnt hear him because I was focused on this work convo. He then became frustrated I wasnt listening and was distracted and I had to remind him Im at WORK. He leaves frustrated and its an annoying start to the day.

My husbands great and its not a big deal but just a uniquely work from home problem and I cant be the only one.

Whats the dumbest conflict youve had with a partner because of WFH?

Edit to share a few thoughts: 

1. This is a work from home issue because if I was in the office, my husband would call me if he had a question and I would have the opportunity to answer the call, send a text saying call you in 5, or reject the call and call back in a few minutes. And there would be no frustration as a result. There is no presumption of availability when one is working in the office as there can often be at home.

2. Your responses were illuminating. I see a lot of people suggesting that family always comes before work. Which I agree with! But it's interesting to see there seems to be two versions of what this looks like. One group believes ""family first"" means no matter the task, your family can interrupt you at any given moment because they are more important.

I personally believe that ""family first"" means my husband and I put one another first, before ourselves. This means respecting that we both have careers, that no - are not the most important job in the world - but are important to us, so we respect and support each other in those respective careers. Of course if it was an emergency or an urgent question, I would drop everything. But there is also an element of both of us assessing the urgency of the task, then asking permission to engage with the other (ie. ""do you have a moment?""). This communicates respect and rejects a sense of entitlement that we ""owe"" each other our attention. 

3. To clarify, I did not hear my husband and purposefully ignore him. When I am really focused on a task or conversation, it's difficult for me to hear things happening around me. ","WFH",491,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/1doly7o/tell_me_im_not_the_only_one/"
"2023-07-07",1688713755,"Corporate meeting was today to justify why were RTO. Want to hear about it?","Yes this is long and yes this is a throwaway. Why am I anon? As much as Paychex corporate is driving me insane, they still pay me money, and whaddya know, I need it.

Paychex is one of the corporations returning to office. They promised a ton of us WFH myself included upon hiring. Many of us have been for years. They announced RTO last week. Some people have posted about it here already

Today we had a town hall virtual meeting. Well over 400 people on attendance while high-ranking management tookcturns doing their quarterly reviews etc.

We do know a lot of you have questions about recent happenings like the return to office/hybrid direction were headed. We will cover that in a bit.

And they did eventually. However they skated past it to cover other topics that nobody really cared about. 440 people were there chiefly for one reason:!why are you taking away wfh?

they  spent most of the meeeting covering figures, projections, the usual. We all knew that they wouldnt address RTO til the end. Its textbook. Make people sit through boring garbage for an hour, theyll be less fired up at the end when that topic comes up.

Theytold us that the company is making record strides, weve hit record numbers (and they *are* impressive), were kicking butt. Weve literally hit all of our goals and then some in just about every possible way. Were branching out here, there, creating new program here, testing this for clients here, you all are wonderful.

They are proud of us, and we should be proud of ourselves. They are very fortunate to be leading our multiple departments in exciting new endeavors.

You know, corporate stuff.

Then the moment arrives. Why no wfh? Supposedly some 3rd party company has lot of detailed data and research showing that the wfh has actually hurt productivity, especially with new hires. They assured us of course that this analysis was very thorough. People who get hired on will get where they need to be quicker in an office setting, knowledge and skill-wise.

K I can get behind that. In-person training honestly should be required for my department. 

By the way this is well over an hour into the meeting they finally bring this up. This whole time people have been lighting up the meeting chat about the RTO order. **No anonymity.** nowhere to hide,and they dont care.

Corporate suits proceed to tell us that productivity will be boosted by RTO, that were actually not hitting certain internal metrics that we were achieving pre-pandemic when everyone was in office, that certain performance trends need to be corrected or balanced.

They then continued on to talk about some new &amp; exciting training programs and onboarding new employees.

They just skated past the wfh topic and moved on.

Look I dont think **anyone** thought anything would really be resolved at a company review meeting with hundreds of employees watching& but the chat blew up.

My personal favorite: you just spent over an hour telling us how productivity is through the roof and the companys figures have never been better, and now youre telling us that because some new hires slacked off, we all have to pay the price?

Someone called the pre/post pandemic citing irrelevant since its common knowledge that a very good chunk of Payhex employees were already wfh well before that.

Employees, supervisor, team lead, a 17 year veteran, someone who piloted some new program for the company, everyone was relentless and it was so satisfying. Someone said so becausecnew hires cant discipline themselves we, the tenured people who have boosted your companys amazing performance, have to pay the price?

Someone chimed in demanding if performance was poor enough to bring us all back into office, how the heck are we putting up these amazing numbers?

Well I think a lot of us in this subreddit know that Companies that own buildings/commercial real estate arent getting what they paid for with tons of people gone. They want more oversight, more control. They want to lay people off but dont want to pay unemployment, so they try to get people to quit.

One individual in the chat said The 33 years Ive been w Paychex, I have never felt this undervalued.

And of course at the end we got the usual thx so much for all your hard work, well review the questions in the chat very soon, etc.

On one hand, I understand that the people on that call couldnt/didnt want to start answering those heated comments because a) there were way too many b) the shots were being called by the suits *above* these suits, c) you cant make an angry mob happy with answers that arent what the mob is looking for.

But the fact that they seriously spent over 60 minutes praising us for our hard work, elevating the company to new heights and profits, commended us for accomplishing so much while ao much expansion was going on, etc& only to then give us that piss poor excuse suddenly about well, internally though, the numbers dont lie and this and that metrics keep falling lower every year, etc&

Its not that I cant work in an office. Trust me Ive I done much worse. To work in an office is a privilege. Thats not th problem.

The problem is you promised me during my interview that Full time wfh during would be an option after 3 years w the company. 

**The even bigger problem is I am literal walking proof that my entire job and all of its responsibilities, both client facing and internal, can be done from my living room.**

To any nay-sayers, I can do my job *well* too. My performance reviews agree. My productivity has actually skyrocketed compared to being in office.

Its the principle of it. Dont til us numbers are down when they arent. Source? You, like 4 minutes ago. Dont insult my/our intelligence.

You might be wondering how some anonvposter on Reddit thinks theyre so intelligent when theyve  madelike a hundred typos and mistakes in this posts.

Cause this is a throwaway and the dummber they think I am, the better. Also it s hardd to defeat autocorrect.

Paychex leadership: if it aint broke, dont fix it. Were killing it because youve given us great work/life balance. Do not ever underestimate the value of great work/life balance. For most of us, this is why we came, why we stayed, and why many are already packing.

EDIT: a bunch of people also voiced compensation for RTO. Some people live much further away, others have sold a car because they dont need it, others will have to now fork out $ for expensive child daycare, etc. Which honestly corporate will probably shrug at, and I cant necessarily blame them for that.

multiple people also outright asked did you consider how many of us youre going to lose with a decision like this? (Spoiler: they certainly did. During our first RTO meeting last week we were told that dont worry the company took into account resulting attrition& meaning yeah we know and we dont care, well just hire more.","WFH",336,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/14szkg8/corporate_meeting_was_today_to_justify_why_were/"

In our most recent company announcements, they backtracked and said that they wont ask anything of anyone that doesnt make sense. They spouted off about how happy everyone who *did* RTO is, and how great the offices are, but if you are more productive at home or most of your team isnt located near your office, you wont be made to return. 

I think that enough people quit and/or threatened to quit that it forced the company to take a much softer stance on RTO. I guess the moral of the story is to hold firm, ignore RTO demands, and begin the search for a new job as soon as they sound the alarms.

"2024-03-07",1709823735,"Teams is getting aggressive with status detection and setting me away really quickly. Best current ways to keep it active?","To preface this, like with many office/desk/tech jobs I often finish my daily tasks early and have time to kill. I assume my coworkers/manager pay attention to my Teams status because of prior conversations like if I logged on early to start my day before a meeting (e.g. ""I noticed you were online""). I'd much rather not sit at my desk waving my mouse to keep Teams active.

I'm using the ""new"" version of Teams (maybe I need to switch back?) and something I've noticed is that the status is, as of a few weeks ago, getting really aggressive at changing to away.

My work laptop display times out pretty quickly and locks the screen, which also sets the status to away (I've tried changing the time out, I think it's a security policy thing).

Because of this and the aforementioned early task completion, I have been using a little utility called Windows Caffeinated to keep the device awake. I've read through the code, rather than simulating periodic key presses like other utilities this one actually just keeps a thread active for the set amount of time, or indefinitely.

This utility used to keep my Teams status available for the duration it was active, but no longer. After a few minutes it defaults to away.

The other trick I've tried is to open up a meeting by myself and switch it manually to available so it doesn't say I'm in a call. Lately, it has been changing itself back to in a call after some time which is frustrating. 

Anybody have any other methods they use?

As far as I can tell there aren't any surveillance tools on my laptop that could detect software/hardware (or if there are my company aren't using or checking them lol... I'd probably have gotten called out by now).

I started a new job in August 2021 that was fully remote at that point due to COVID, with the idea that wed move to a hybrid model in time. After 8 months, we moved to two days a week on-site. This was great for about another 8-9 months. 

At that point my partner and I were starting to talk about moving in together. He owns his place, I rented, so it made sense to move into his place. Id been renting an apartment a five minute drive from my office; his place is a 35 min to 45 min drive, but I figured I could deal with it twice a week. 

In February, we were told we needed to start coming in 4x a week because reasons. (There is zero business case that anyone has been able to convey. It appears the real reason is - surprise, surprise - to justify commercial office space). 

Ive just finished moving in with my partner, and wow, did I underestimate how much a 45 minute drive to work SUCKS after having not done any meaningful commuting since Feb 2020. I get so much less sleep now that I have to deal with shower/hair/makeup/commute before getting my day started. In the evening, Im so much more exhausted after work. 

Im an individual contributor, so by design I need to ignore other people in order to do my work. My work doesnt lend itself to collaboration. The only collaborating that happens is my small team sitting around venting to each other about how utterly pointless it is to be on-site.

On top of this, my company is doing renovations to our office space. I was told with just a few hours notice last month that I had to pack up everything and move to a new cubicle to make way for construction work. No one told IT, and my new cubicle wasnt wired for Ethernet (and the wifi constantly drops). Its been a month and still no Ethernet. 

So I have to get up early, get all dolled up, pack a lunch, then spend 45 min in traffic  just to use the same laptop I could use at home, but also having to use my personal phone as a mobile hotspot when the wifi drops.

Many years prior, we had all had a chance to invest in the commercial real estate that we would then lease to the Firm.  Eventually, the lease payments from the Firm would pay off the mortgage and the individual partners who owned the building would have a nice nest egg.  I decided not to invest in the building for many reasons andIm glad.  When I retired from the Firm and started my own firm in my home office, I had no further ties to them.

Fast forward to the pandemic.  Suddenly everyone realized that we didnt need all that expensive office space.  At the Firm, some of the partners wanted to go fully remote and no longer lease that office space.  But the partners that owned the building realized they NEEDED the space to be filled so the mortgage could be paid.

To clarify, Im talking about those that send these messages when they are not personal friends, but trying to make a request of you. Id expect it from casual friends just chatting. Its such a minor pet peeve of mine. I am all for nice greetings and even some small talk, but in a remote environment where we bounce between multiple projects, I would rather the person follow their hello with exactly what they need. Just get to the point! This gives me time to look up the answer and respond accordingly. I feel like these people are the same ones that would walk several floors and go to your desk and interrupt your work flow for something that is probably not your top priority if they could. They want your undivided attention for everything and if thats the case, setup a meeting. I time block and create running task lists. Working remotely gives me the ability to gate keep my time and it is my absolute favorite benefit of it. 

Ill be honest& I get petty with it and sort of retaliate sometimes lol. When I see this, I will let the message sit longer before I answer back or even jump into a fake meeting, mark myself away, or whatever. I switch it up. I guess my goal is to teach them a lesson to use meeting invites or just communicate the ask initially. I know its petty. Then, when I answer back, I just say hi again. When they finally ask their question, I tell them Ill need to look it up and get back to them even if I know it off the top of my head. 

Im not saying my method is the right way to handle it, but Im curious if others get annoyed by this? Maybe Im in the minority and there is a valid reason to use Teams this way. My wife works remotely too and it also drives her nuts. She is just nicer than I am about it. Does anyone else gate keep their time?

I got a new job that is 5 days in the office and took a $10K paycut (which I thought would end up not making a difference, but it really does smh). I bought a car and of course, with the car came expenses for gas every week and a half, required maintenance and the dreaded insurance. At my job, there is also heavy pressure to go to happy hour and drink heavily, as well as spend money to participate in activities for ""the office culture"".

  
I realized immediately I made a huge mistake taking this in-office job. I know that I can start bringing lunches from home, say no to happy hours and activities, etc, but along with taking a paycut, I am losing so much money.

  
I am debating finding a remote job again so that I can save money and hopefully get a higher salary. I also hate going into the office. Is this a good idea? I would still have the car and its expenses, but I could potentially sell it.

Since the pandemic, Ive seen articles arguing:

- WFH is ruining the economy, killing cities
- Workers are desperate to get back to the office (this was more prevalent during Covid itself; now they seem to be accepting employers are forcing people back)
- WFH is for poor performers
- WFH is due to a lack of commitment
- WFH means you cant onboard properly or bond in teams
- WFH is bad for mental health
- WFH ruins your chances of promotions, and in fact makes you more likely to lose your jobs

Im probably not alone in guessing theres a landlord-driven agenda behind all this. And that theres an attempt to drive a wedge between people who WFH, those who work hybrid, and those who have to travel to work.

But it seems& unrelenting! It tends to come in waves or clusters of articles. And it doesnt seem to be slowing down.

Is this just media noise or will it succeed in clawing back the gains in work/life balance, mental health, and job satisfaction weve seen since 2020?

"2024-03-28",1711629475,"Remote jobs are up 10% from a year ago and 31% 6 months ago","Is remote work dead or here to stay? I analyzed 1M remote job openings in the past year to find out. Here's what I learned..

1) Remote jobs are making a comeback

The % of new jobs that were listed as remote is up 10% year over year, and 31% from a year ago. After a decline for more than a year, remote jobs have been on an uptrend.

2) Senior level jobs are more likely to be remote than mid-level and entry-level jobs

5.35% of senior-level jobs were remote in the past year, compared to 4.9% for mid-level and 2.48% for entry level. 

Remote work is a privilege that must be earned and companies seem to trust experienced professionals more with that privilege

3) Director and VP jobs were more likely to be remote than individual contributor jobs

This one surprised me a bit as we've heard the stories on how senior executives want employees back in the office. 

But the data tells a different story. Companies are more likely to hire VP and Directors remotely than lower level workers. This was true even in the tech sector, among both big companies and startups.

4) Preferences for remote work differ drastically by profession and industry

Engineers and tech workers vastly prefer working remotely. In fact, the large majority prefer 5 days a week of remote work.

When I polled my Twitter followers (who primarily work in the financial industry), they all preferred a hybrid environment, and a fair share even preferred working 1-2 days at home a week.

5) Salaries for remote jobs are essentially the same as non-remote jobs

I compared the average salary of jobs that were remote to those that were non-remote for the same job title. There was essentially no difference between the two.

6) Remote jobs from US-based companies have stayed mostly within the US.

Whether it's because of legal or logistical reasons, most remote jobs from US-based companies have remained in the US, and that trend has been fairly consistent the past 4-5 years. 

I also analyzed which countries have the highest % of remote jobs, which job titles are most likely to be remote, and whether theres a correlation between remote work and work satisfaction.

Does anyone know the real reason for the big push to get people back in the office or work in a hybrid model? 

I know there is the often touted and ridiculous ""idea generation and harming culture"" reasons, but there has to be more to it than that. Ideas don't come from being forced together. They come from being free to let your mind wander and collaborating with people - neither requiring an office. 

To me, forcing people to go into an office is like moving wild birds into cages. They've learned to fly freely, navigate, and socialise in the open environment, demonstrating their ability to function and even thrive without the cage's confines. Putting them in a cage doesn't improve their creativity, productivity or relationship with other birds. All you're doing in that instance is stifling their newfound creativity and adaptability. 

If your company culture requires people to be in a cage, it might indicate that the culture is based on control and confinement rather than trust and empowerment. If that's the case, I'd argue that your culture isn't worth saving.","WFH",595,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/1520cip/whats_the_real_reason_for_the_push_to_get_people/"

Okay here is the trick. Ive only tried on iPhone so bear that in mind too. 

Download the Microsoft Teams app on your phone and log in. Have the Teams app open on your phone. 

Then, open up a YouTube video (I turn on Hulu live tv) and keep it playing.

Open the Teams app back up so the video is minimized and playing in the top corner, but Teams is the main app that is open. 

As long as the video does not end, you will show as online. The video keeps your phone from going to sleep, which keeps you active on Teams. 

I tried this trick with Teams open on my computer at the same time (didnt touch the computer for an extended period of time but kept it open to test the theory) and Teams never showed me as away.

CEOs and other C suite members love to talk about the benefits of on-site collaboration and all being in the same room - I'm not here to argue about that, there *are* genuine benefits which you could use to support RTO if you felt so inclined.

But one thing that constantly gets ignored is that while offices may be better for face-to-face meetings, they are far, far, FAR worse for Zoom/Teams calls.

Picture the scenario - you're in an open plan office with dozens of other people surrounding you in nearby desks. You have 3 hours of virtual meetings today - some around you have more, others less. Either way, whenever you are on calls, you'll probably have a minimum of 4 or 5 other people around you also on other virtual calls, and the ones that aren't are often conversing about anything and everything. Either way, the background noise is horrendous and makes it VERY difficult to parse what other people on your call are saying. Not to mention if whoever you're on calls with is ALSO in office, there'll be a ton of background noise their end too.

This wouldn't be so bad if the office wasn't open plan or if there were more private meeting rooms. But there are far too few meeting rooms for the demand, and the open plan office battle has been fought and lost.

Which ok cool. I won't be coming in. Right? Oh, no. Your supervisor still has the right to deny full time work from home. So guess who not only can't WFH full time. But also loses their office and has to share a desk on an entirely different floor as the rest of the team. I thought this was about teamwork and relationship building? 

Orrrr you can keep your office by coming in 3 days a week or more.

Theyre in a fairly rural area and as a result have a hard time finding people with experience that they can put into more senior roles like mine. 

I work a lot with our customers and the products I manage represent about $200M in revenue. A large part of that business is due to the relationships Ive developed with our customers. They definitely have other options. 

Anyway, I was 100% WFH all through Covid and through the experience, I came to a few realizations. Mainly that I hated the commute, an hour each way. I live in a small city and commute out to the boonies for work. 

So, when we started going back to the office, I wasnt really happy about it, but in my case, it was only 1 day/week, and thats probably reasonable for my job. Then it was 3 days in office but only if you filled out a form and justified it. A couple of months ago, they announced that we were all going back to full RTO, 5 days/week. I tried to protest, but despite data to the contrary my boss, his boss and on up the chain firmly believe the Were more productive IN the office! BS. 

Theyre having a hard time hiring. Candidates will ask in the phone screen, Is this position remote or hybrid? and as soon as they hear, No, were in the office 5days/week., 90% of the candidates will say, Im not interested then. Needless to say, this means there are a lot of open positions. 

Retention is declining slowly, but its mostly among people with just a couple of YOE and its easier to spread the workload around to the other employees doing the same work. 

Ive tried giving feedback to management that I was not happy with RTO, but they were not listening. So about 2-3 months ago I started looking elsewhere, just casually at first, but almost immediately, I started getting interviews and then an offer at a company that is about 10 minutes away. Much better pay, better benefits, more vacation and best of all theres pretty much a Come in to the office if you need/want to otherwise WFH. Theyre also paying for a nice sit/stand desk and a chair to use at home. Offer accepted!

I type up my notice letter, print 3 copies. Its just the basic three sentences. (Thank you for the opportunities, Its time to move on and this date will be my last day) One copy for my boss, one for his boss and one for HR. The HR copy I drop in their mailbox and the other two, I leave in their respective offices on their keyboards. Then I go about my day.

The next morning, Im greeted by my boss and his boss both of whom are wearing a scowling version of the surprised Pikachu face. They ask me why. I tell them I havent been happy for a while and if they have to ask, they havent been paying attention. 

They make a counteroffer, I decline. They make a better one, I decline again. They ask me what they can do to get me to stay. Finally, I tell them that theres nothing to be done about it at this point, the time to act was all of those times I asked to WFH whenever possible and was denied. Repeatedly. They werent happy about the breakup, but they made their bed, let them lie in it. 

During my transition, I tried to wrap things up as best I could and lay out the immediate needs for each project and I informed my customers. 

I dont know exactly what the fallout from my departure was, but one of my former colleagues did tell me that its been a complete shitshow.

"2023-10-29",1698542578,"I stopped coming into the office and& nothing happened","Well theres actually some context but thats the gist.

Long story short, I work for a very large company. Several thousand employees all across the country. I was 100% in office for years, including any OT. Then in March 2020 they told us to stop coming into the office& and work went on. Everybody got their jobs done from home.

Then RTO happened in March 2022, three days a week. Then they went to 4 days a week a few months ago. It sucked. I have a nice home office. My chair is more comfortable. I have windows and sunlight. My monitors are much bigger. I can have music or videos in the background, and I am soooo much more productive at home. But I only worked from home one day a week, plus OT. So in total, up to 30 hours a week from home, and 32 hours in office. Not bad.

But sometime in December I started to get headaches on days I was in the office. They really started to affect my work performance. I didnt realize how bad it got until I went on vacation for 2 weeks and felt better. It was like waking up from a dream. So when I got back, I went to the doctor and asked them to write me out. They did for two weeks.

It took a few days for my headache to go away. And then I was free. But heres the crazy part. I sent the medical accommodation to HR, and they said theyll review and approve it. And they just never got back to me! I followed up daily until they said they have a committee that meets once a week to approve these requests. And I guess they just havent been meeting? When my two weeks were up, I got another note for a month. Submitted that one and again, zero movement. My plan is to get them for three months at a time going forward.

So officially, I am cleared to WFH until the committee approves me working from home. Bureaucracy at its finest! So technically, I am not approved to WFH, but I gave my management an excuse and stopped showing up. Nobody is questioning it. Honestly I could have made something up and nobody would care. I just got lost in the cracks. Wild.

The affects of being back at home are massive. Ive lost about 15 pounds this month. Im eating better, I have time to take long walks. My relationship with my wife improved. I get to play with the kids. Im sleeping much better as well, and without meds! Almost no snoring which makes my wife happy. And most importantly, I havent had a headache in almost a month.

We live in a neighborhood, and the house next door is close to the garage, but it would certainly not be a problem with noise if someone were to be inside their house. The drums are no louder than a lawn mower, or some utility work, table saw, etc.

 So we got this text from the neifjbir that she was in a zoom meeting and asked if we could stop, and also to chat at some point about scheduling drumming and her work calls. We were like oh wow okay I guess it is disrupting her ability to work in her own home, fair enough. Then I go outside a few minutes later and see that she is setup outside on her patio on a lovely July day working, outside. And I'm like, um no? Like no we can't accommodate you wanting quiet/private calls in your backyard in a neighborhood in July...? Is this reasonable at all? I'm tempted to say hey I'm sorry but we can't accommodate that.

In the beginning, I still dressed in my office attire because I assumed I'd be on camera in meetings a lot more but I started noticing the people I met with either weren't on cam or they were wearing t-shirts or hoodies so I figured I'd relax my look a little more. But I'd like to snap out of that without going full business casual. I can feel the small bit of femininity I have left slipping through my fingers lol

My work has me connecting to systems across the US and in major cities around the world every day. My team is geographically dispersed and I have never met any of them face to face. My boss lives in another state, joining a long series of managers I have had that I have never met. His boss lives in a third state.

My company also used to have a very good WFH program, that I was part of for several years. I never had any issues at all with productivity or attendance. That program got shuttered a few years before Covid hit, so I worked from the office in the afternoons a few days a week, and still did the bulk of my work from home. When the lockdowns hit in March of 2020, I was still mostly WFH, so it was an easy transition for me to WFH full time again. I just kept on keeping on, and still had no performance issues.

But now we're being told we have to return to the office 2-3 days a week. And, not surprisingly, I keep getting notifications that someone in the building has tested positive for the coronavirus. So I've decided I'm not going to go, at least not really.

They track how often we enter the building by scanning badges at the door, so I will scan my badge to get my ID in the log, and then I will turn around an go straight home again. I live close enough to the office that I can do this on my lunch break without any issue. I'm just going to continue WFH, and only nominally enter the building. My boss and his boss have both endorsed this behavior, but the drive for RTO is coming from far above their level.

Can we just talk about how stressful it is to have the webcam on for every single Zoom meeting? Don't get me wrong, video calls are here to stay, but there's something about the pressure of constantly being on camera that just drains the life out of me.

I get it, it helps with engagement, makes meetings more personal, but let's be honest - sometimes you're just there to listen and participate, not be on display like a zoo animal.  It's like having a spotlight on you for hours, making sure you're presentable, your background isn't messy, and that you're constantly engaged.  Even having a good hair day doesn't cut it!

Maybe it's just me, but I find myself way more focused and productive when I can switch the camera off. No more self-consciousness, no more worrying about making eye contact down the barrel of a webcam.  Just pure focus on the meeting content.

Commuting:
1. Gas - I would commute 13 miles one way to my previous role downtown. Since gas is roughly $5 a gallon where I live and my car gets 30 miles to a gallon then I would be spending $4.33 a day to commute. 

2. Car maintenance - lets say with the extra amount of driving to and from the office causes additional wear and tear on my vehicle then I would be spending an additional $300 a year or $1.25 a day to maintain it. 

3. Time sitting in traffic - I make roughly $80 an hour in my role and if it took 1.5 hours a day to drive to and from work then it would be worth $120 dollars a day to sit in traffic. I could be using that time being productive in my role at home. 

The cost of commuting for me: $125.58/day or $32,650.80 a year. 

4. Clothing costs - I dont have to have a professional wardrobe unless Im flying to the corporate office. Id say I would spend roughly $600 a year on professional clothes. 

5. Flexibility - the ability to run errands during the day, intercepting packages, meeting contractors to do work on the house and being able to pick up my children during the day without a big interruption in my work is the best perk for me. It is hard to quantify but if I  had to put a dollar amount on this then I would say its worth $10 a day or $2600 a year for me.

I still meet all my expectations at work and feel much more productive than when Im in office due to my severe ADHD (hearing others and getting interrupted from my work really takes me out of the flow of things) but we all have those days Im sure. A lot of this is rooted in my own mental health issues I am going through and I have started medication and starting therapy soon. Im glad to hear many people are taking care of themselves if they can because I truly believe that happy employees are the most productive and healthy ones. Hopefully employers can learn that we are not machines and technology not only allows us to get the work done more efficiently but also allows us to be flexible with out everchanging lives.","WFH",239,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/1b6k1dx/does_anyone_else_have_days_they_dont_do_much_work/"

* Company mandates RTO, the more days per week, the more people they want gone
* Employees decide they'd rather not RTO, so they quit
* Employer doesn't have to lay off any, or as many people, due to the quitters.

Sure, some people have avoided the RTO mandates for now.  But if your employer is playing this ploy, those who ignore the mandate will be fired.

The employer can change your work arrangement at any time unless you have a union.  That is how the game works, people.  Even if you were hired ""fully remote"", they can change you to ""in-office"" at anytime.

I have been working remotely since March 2020. I was recently found by a recruiter for a role that **would pay more than double what I am currently making** and it would provide more job security. 

Problems:
- I love WFH *but* I work for a nonprofit (wages are low, emotional baggage is high, and we are constantly worried about funding and losing our jobs). 
- I would have to commute, on a train, for about 1.5 hours each way (!) to the new job. I dont think there is much flexibility on this policy from what I have seen on Glassdoor. 


Partner and I are DINK (for now). My expenses are low and I am not exactly hard up for money, but the new salary would mean drastically improving my savings/investments/financial goals. However, WFH has been incredible and Im not sure Im ready to give it up.

I mastered my job but there was some room for learning. My pay was okay, not the best. With rising costs of living, I wanted more.

I joined a fortune 100 company, top 20 best to work, everyone I know loves it there, half the workforce is remote or hybrid 1 day a week, known for career growth and development. 

Second week at my mew job I am realizing now  that 1 day a week sucks...I hate traffic so much. I was used to being remote and going on site only if needed which was rare. I now fight rush hour traffic, parking, etc.  I sit looking busy waiting foe the clock. 

It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't during rush hour and if they didn't expect us to be there all day. Even though I am salaried exempt, my boss is expecting a set schedule of 8 hours worked plus lunch and making up hours if missed. I never experienced this before.. I guess her idea of flexibility as we discussed is different. 

I was spoiled my last job, much happier. Alittle more money wasn't worth it. I wish I would've stayed and be more picky. The job also isn't exactly what I thought it'd be either.

I am trying to see if maybe I'll feel better in a few months before trying to leave but I am keeping an eye out. I'm just sad, wonder if I will get lucky to find another job I'm happy at.

My manager fought for us to remain remote since thats what we were before but their manager basically didnt want to hear it. My manager was on the brink of tears when he shared that he failed us. 

In addition to this expectation, the only locations we have ample space for the workforce in my immediate vicinity is in a major city. Parking is not free and is paid for out of pocket by each employee. There are no convenient parking garages nor lots as they were sold to build apartments or hotels around the office. When I took this job, I waited for about 2-3 months before re-doing my personal budget, essentially re-allocating money otherwise budgeted for work travel expenses to other goals (buying a house, paying down student loans, etc.). Now, Im being asked to foot the bill for gas, parking, car maintenance and other related expenses that were never expected of me, and all without any pay increase. 

Financial situation aside, I had a huge traumatic event before I transitioned to this role which basically drove me to find something fully WFH to help me handle anxiety and stress better and in a way that makes sense for me. My mental health is better, I can take walks when I need to re-center myself to prevent panic attacks, and I can control everything from light to temperature in my home office to help avoid me from feeling overwhelmed. 

Im just annoyed at the whole situation. Being in an office benefits literally no one. Ill be head down in an office the whole day and essentially taking office space from someone who may need it for clients or actual in-person collaboration. And Ill be more stressed out about my mental health and financial well-being.

# And now it's time for the buyer's guide

First, think about the size of your workspace. Imagine the freedom of having a larger desk surface, with enough room for your computer, monitor, and other office supplies. Normally a good standing desk will have the tabletop of 48x24"", 60x30"" or bigger (72x30"" or 80x30"").

Then, look for a desk that can be adjusted to your height, giving you the perfect ergonomic position to work comfortably for long periods. It's so important because the taller guys above 6' may not like the desk with height range under 48"" at max height setting. A good height range from 22-23"" and up to 49-50"", that's standard!

Consider the material of the desk too - a classic wooden desk can provide warmth and elegance, while a modern metal desk can add an industrial edge to your home office.

Think about the desk's weight capacity: At least 176 lbs or great 220 lbs. That's the ideal one. Make sure the desk can support your computer, monitor, and any other equipment you use. Look for desks with higher weight capacities if you need to support heavier equipment. And of course with high-end products, they can support 355 lbs

# Benefits of using a standing desk while working from home:

1. Improved posture: Standing while working can help improve your posture, as it promotes a more natural position for your spine.
2. Increased energy and productivity: Standing can increase blood flow and oxygen to the brain, which can help boost your energy levels and productivity.
3. Lower risk of obesity and heart disease: Studies have shown that sitting for extended periods can increase the risk of obesity and heart disease. Standing while working can help reduce this risk.
4. Reduced back pain: Sitting for long periods can lead to back pain and other musculoskeletal issues. Standing while working can help alleviate some of this pain and discomfort.
5. Better overall health: Standing while working can provide numerous health benefits, including lower blood sugar levels, improved circulation, and reduced risk of certain types of cancer.","WFH",29,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/10uvuq2/best_standing_desk_for_work_from_home_from_under/"

You get the offer, sign the offer doc through HR, and then proceed to do background check/work authorization documentation, etc. You will never be asked to do anything that sounds odd. They will never ask for your bank account, or for you to transfer money, or anything like that.

November 14, 2023 Miriam Hall, New York City 

Revenue at companies with flexible work-from-home policies grew four times faster than those with in-person requirements, according to a new study by Scoop Technologies and Boston Consulting Group.  
  
The findings, from a survey that analyzed 556 public companies that employ a collective 26.5 million people across 20 sectors, represent a significant blow for proponents  and owners  of office space.  
  
Firms that allow their employees to either work entirely from home or pick the days they come in increased sales 21% between 2020 and 2022, per the survey, first reported by Bloomberg. Companies with hybrid or full-time office policies saw revenue growth of just 5%.  
  
Among the companies that do require office work, those that allowed just a few days in-person saw sales go up at twice the rate of those that demanded workers come into the office full-time.  
  
This starts to be a more compelling case for CFOs and CEOs to not be five days in the office, Scoop co-founder and CEO Rob Sadow told Bloomberg. People ask if revenue growth is the best proxy  you could also look at shareholder returns. There is no perfect answer, but we felt this was a first step in the right direction.  
  
The revenue growth in the survey was normalized against average industry growth rates, so the findings weren't skewed by higher-performing sectors.  
One possible explanation is that flexible workplace policies allow companies to hire from a broader range of people, and to recruit more quickly.  
At Allstate, for example, remote-friendly jobs receive double the number of applications, Fortune reported. A total of 84% of its new employees in the U.S. in the last year dont live near a company office. The insurance giant slashed its real estate footprint by over 50% alongside its embrace of remote work.  
  
The remote work debate has raged for years now, as workers, employers and office landlords have debated the best way to drive productivity. While office owners have stressed that in-office work is the best way to do business, employees have often balked at returning to their desks in the same way they did before the pandemic. Some sectors, like law firms, have taken a more hardline approach and mandated that their workers come back to the office.  
Tech firms gave workers a lot of flexibility, but have in recent months brought workers back, with companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google mandating multiple office days per week this year. More than 3 million workers are expected to be under new office attendance mandates this year, according to JLL.   
  
Those mandates have yet to result in a large bump in office occupancy, and office markets in places like New York continue to be affected by the rise of remote work. The availability rate in Manhattan, the countrys largest office market, was at 17.8% in October, according to Colliers.

I genuinely could cry.","Been a middle level healthcare manager my entire career. Executive leadership disappointed for you not being able to always do more with less, your team resenting (understandably) you for trying to do more with less, the Pandemic has made this industry next to impossible and frankly unsustainable. I feel terrible for the clinical team members I was responsible for. Healthcare is just disgusting how they have treated front line staff. I could not perpetuate that environment any longer. Only reason I put up with it was to support my family. \~600 applications, countless interviews and *failures.* So many failures. Finally, that is all going to change.

I landed a permanent remote position as a healthcare/healthtech manager (an absolute unicorn as the opportunities are few and far between), significantly more money, I name my own hours, occasionally get to travel the country, and have the best benefits I ever had for my family. It still does not feel real. I feel my mental health dramatically improving and I haven't even started the job. For the first time in my life, I am genuinely excited to work for an organization. I never thought I would be here. No job is perfect, I get that, but improvement is what I am looking for. Even if the job is just a tough/stressful, having it be WFH is just a little more manageable.

**What I am looking forward to in no particular order:**

* Work outside when weather gets warmer. This is HUGE for me as most healthcare offices for managers never have windows. I have never had a workspace with a window. I despise artificial light, the harm it has done on my migraines, and the effect it has had on my mental health. I would arrive at work before the sun rose and leave after it has set. No more.
* The freedom to name my own hours
* Use the time I used for my commute to go to the gym.
* My dogs are now my co-workers. Being able to take them on walks throughout the day. 
* When I have children, I will actually be able to see them throughout the day. No more being gone from 730a-630p.
* I will never have to wear a suit and tie again except when I have needed travel
* Being able to play music, TV, etc. in the background
* Do the needed occasional house chores so my SO can relax when they get home/we have to catch up on the weekends
* Run errands when needed. Errands are currently loaded onto the weekends, making the workweek feel even longer and weekend shorter.
* No more water cooler talk with boomers I do not care about. No more forced chuckling at racist/sexist jokes from VP's/Presidents just so I can keep my job. Fuck them, I am done.
* Personalize my home office. Being able to feel comfortable where I work is something I could never conceive

Its getting harder to find a remote job in the U.S., but you might have better luck working from home for a company based abroad.

The number of American workers hired by international companies grew 62% last year, according to the State of Global Hiring Report from Deel, an HR platform that specializes in global hiring.

The report is based on 300,000 contracts between Deel customers and workers for both contractors and full-time employees, and roughly 85% of those contracts are for remote positions.

American workers are most likely to be hired by companies in the U.K., Canada, France, Singapore and Australia.

The spike in U.S. workers vying for remote jobs headquartered overseas feels correlated with the elimination of remote roles stateside, says Deel CEO Alex Bouaziz. He knows from experience people are quitting jobs with return-to-office requirements to be remote: A couple of our competitors did that, and we hired their best people. So I welcome them to keep doing it.

Workers with unique, in-demand skills being hired internationally

Global employers want to tap into the U.S. talent market because its so large and has produced some of the most influential companies in the world, Bouaziz says. International bosses want to leverage more U.S. talent to bring some of that culture that leads to the biggest enterprises in the world to their home country.

Americans who work remotely for international employers tend to live in San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Austin and Miami. These U.S. economic powerhouses are a playground to hire highly knowledgeable workers with unique skills in product, growth and sales, Bouaziz says. Some of the most common jobs are in research, sales, software engineering, content and product.

A lot of those companies are thinking, How do we build the right playbook that theyve done in the U.S.? Bouaziz adds. One way is to bring U.S. workers to their companies.

By age, roughly half of American workers with contracts via Deel are between 25 and 34 years old; 18% are between 35 and 44, while 25% are 45 years or older.

The upsides and downsides

Working remotely for an internationally company isnt as straightforward as simply working from home.

Aside from figuring out taxes and other HR compliance issues, Bouaziz says its important to consider differences in time zones. A Californian working for a company based in Europe may have to adjust to early hours.

A lot also rides on how the companys distributed workforce is set up: Are you the only American employed by a company abroad, or are you part of a larger group stateside? Do you work from home, or will you go into a satellite office? Does your whole team work the same hours, or do you overlap for part of the day and rely on asynchronous work for the other?

Then, cultural differences come into play from the small things (like holiday time off) to the big (communication norms). Jumping cultures can be quite intense, Bouaziz says. Its something you need to be malleable for. Its not hard, but you do need to understand and accept norms  to make everyone comfortable and do their best work while being considerate.

That being said, accepting the norms of a different countrys work culture can also be a big plus. You may enjoy a different style of communication or perspective on work-life balance. Or you might thrive integrating into an organization with more diversity, Bouaziz says, especially if you get to work with colleagues across multiple countries. Those benefits can extend beyond the workplace, he adds: Different perspectives help you have a different lens on the world.

Being able to bring a company to a new U.S. market can be an interesting challenge, he adds, and you may get to be among the first to bring U.S. culture to an international organization.

If youre interested in landing a remote job for a company based abroad, start by using job boards like LinkedIn and filtering for remote jobs based worldwide. Another resource is Otta, which lists jobs at international startups and trending companies that are more likely to have remote flexibility. (For what its worth, Deel is hiring for 190 open roles around the world, a spokesperson adds.)

Ultimately, dont overthink it too much, Bouaziz says. Youll find that people, wherever you go, tend to be nice.","WFH",38,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/1akmbpr/us_workers_are_getting_scooped_up_by/"

"2023-11-02",1698922285,"Would you leave WFH for 60k more?","I got offered a position that is fully in office, but have been torn on taking it. I have been working from home for the last 5 years and I love the flexibility of wfh and I cannot stand commuting. Heres the pros and cons with each company:

Company 1 (where I currently work):

Pros:

- Fully remote
- I have a good reputation here, get along well with most
- Limited office politics since wfh
- Good work/life balance 
- Manageable stress
- Very stable job 
- Glassdoor rating is 4.7 out of 5 

-Have animals that love me being home 


Cons:

- Lower range on salary for my field (Ive had the only promotion you can get for my role, so maximum raise going forward is 3% each year) 

-Boss is kind of weird and aggressive at times
- Im a mid level senior manager and there is no growth in site unless someone dies or retires (my peers have been in same position for over 13 years) realistically, Im looking at 7-8 years in same position
- Health benefits so-so
- Limited diversity 


Company 2-

Pros:

- Great salary- I could make $50-$60k more annually (base salary) plus annual bonus. 
- Interesting field
- Ability to learn a lot, autonomy to build out/restructure dept 
- Title I would want, if I stick it out for a year, itll set my path going forward for better salary and title.
- Benefits covered 100%

Cons:

- I found out the person before me was fired after 3 weeks, and found out in final interview 2 people have been fired for this role. (Hiring mgr shared they are fire happy)

-Major startup vibes 
- High turnover (although they say they are cleaning house for the better) 
- Glassdoor ratings are awful with it saying its a toxic environment- 2.5 out of 5 
- An hour commute there and back (2hrs)
- Fully in office 
- It seems like itll be high stress 

Ive left a stable job for more money before and have been miserable, but it lead me to this job which Im thankful for. Theres major red flags here, but I have the experience thats needed to change some things and it could set me up exponentially for the future.


Thanks for the response everyone! To give some additional context- I make $100k, so this would be a 60% raise for me. I would use the extra money to pay off debt, and save for my own place. I currently rent an apartment with a roommate. 

I live in CA where cost of living is extremely high. Im not open to move, I love CA. 

There would be a bump in title and money. I had to do some pre-work for the company as part of the interview process, and I actually know I can make new processes and new impactful changes, but the reviews and firing someone for 3 weeks makes me nervous.

Ive worked for startups before, and built departments from scratch- but I know how extremely frustrating and inept people can be. ","WFH",677,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/17m0rsl/would_you_leave_wfh_for_60k_more/"

"2023-08-01",1690892296,"Just 4 years ago, working in an office was considered a real job.","I've been WFH for over 10+ years.  During that time I heard it all from my friends..

* ""So, you just sit around playing video games all day""?
* ""When are you going to get a 'real job'?""
* ""So, let me get this straight...you pay for the electricity, internet, buy your own equipment, and use part of your home as an office? Man, they must be saving a fortune on chumps like you!"".

3 years ago, those who were lucky enough to keep their jobs complained about having to do it remotely.  Albeit temporarily. I saw MANY articles and social media posts complaining about how workers were now expected to keep up the same level of productivity at home...without the office.  People were literally asking how long this would last and when they'd be able to get back to the office,

Then we did it. Productivity didn't suffer.  People who had never worked remotely before, had an epiphany.

Now, in just 3 years, no one wants to go into the office for those real jobs anymore. Now all I see are complaints that the temp situation they knew was temp, is now over and the company expects RTO...like they told you they would do from the beginning.

People comparing that there aren't any WFH positions anymore.

Look, people have been working from home since the 90's. There have always been remote  positions, its just that half the workforce wasn't looking for them.  That wasn't considered a real job 4 years ago.

If your job wasn't remote before, it's unlikely it will all of a sudden be remote now. If you're in a profession that is typically not remote, it's unlikely to change soon.

From where I sit there are more remote jobs than ever, but competition for them is steep. Just as attitudes among workers have now changed about remote work, the other thing that has changed is you now have to compete for those positions.

A piece of paper with your work history is not the only consideration now.  A piece of paper says you may be qualified to work in the office,  You need to show employers that you are set up to work remotely, have the equipment and infrastructure needed to be productive, present well, and can work will little supervision and still get the job done.

They'll train you to do the job, they're not going to train you how to be a great remote worker too. They're not going to tell you, you look like crap, you sound like crap, your camera looks like it's shooting through a potato ,or watch you struggle with WiFi issues for a simple Zoom call.  They don't want to hear whining about why you have to be on camera for a meeting.

They will expect that you're a work from home professional. If you're not, you're not getting that job. 

Last thing...If you haven't changed to a field that has always had a lot of remote opportunities, or are still doing the same job as before 2020, you're likely going back to the office same as everyone else.

JMO of course

"2023-09-01",1693576558,"""Let's Be human about this."" OK, you first.","I was hired as an exec to work for a place several states away at the beginning of the pandemic, with a relocation agreement. Since then I have exceeded all metrics -- my organization has been chaotic, and had three top execs, one of which told me not to worry about relocating. My agreement lapsed, and they gave away my office. I do go in periodically, but more often I travel on their behalf, and it's cheaper from my actual home location. They also save beaucoup taxes on my employment, since I'm in a state where they require less payroll taxes. 

So in January the newest exec was appointed over the second one, who had actually been running things for years for the first exec. It has been an unmitigated disaster. Immediately the new exec was blindsided with some regulatory issues that most of the company already knew about. We then reorganized -- I led my team through it, retaining almost everyone despite a lot of adverse situations. Overall we lost about a hundred people, and have been unable to do our jobs as usual for about 6 months now. Meanwhile in all this time there have been no raises, there were furloughs, and it's been an overall very frustrating situation. Right now despite being promised that we would be able to be more agile during the reorg, they're claiming I can't replace my only lost employee, even though the funding for her position comes from an external grant -- they don't even pay for it. Altogether, it's a pretty dissatisfying arrangement right now. 

Anyway, my boss, who's between me and the top exec, decided that I need to RTO now. We had a meeting where he blindsided me with this, and with some complaints about employees in other divisions abusing the remote employee arrangement -- I told him that has nothing to do with me, and I actually am technically hybrid, so it's not even a comparable situation -- and he basically said that I agreed to move and now I need to. He used the phrase ""let's be human about this."" 

I actually have no problem moving -- it's logistically difficult and we barely go into the office, even those who live right there, but I bought a house there when I was hired in anticipation of a move that now seems completely unnecessary so I'm actually kind of set up to do it successfully. With enough notice it's fine. There are even advantages. But it's not ""human"" to arbitrarily decide to make people work from an office where it's actually not necessary. Or, honestly, for a company that hasn't lived up to any of the promises that it made to me as an employee.

WFH

- Put in a load of laundry!

- Try not to cringe physically and inwardly every time your cubicle neighbor snorts due to an allergy.

**- Doing the same amount of work but it takes you all day because of the distractions.**

- Eat a crappy leftover lunch and hear ""Are you on lunch? I just have a quick question....""

- Sit underneath the AC vent with your sweater and electric blanket, ""Are you cold?!""

- Drive in stupid traffic and get rear-ended (three times in 2 years).

I'm not desperate (luckily), I have a fully remote job now and am fine with it, but open to cool opportunities, and this is one.

The CEO really wants to hire a new leader to freshen up the company. My vision/skills/strengths align with exactly what he wants.

It's really that rare situation where I would bring a lot of value, and the job would also offer me career growth. The pay is right, etc.

I don't want to go into specifics, but it's a digital business and in the tech industry.

However, the CEO wants people going into the office 3x/week.

But GET THIS: Half the team is across the damn country from where I am, including himself (my prospective manager) and the person I'd be partnering with to run the whole thing.

One of my top capabilities is creating highly-collaborative work flows and environments, which they are currently lacking. I talked through the methods I use to run all kinds of workshops and how to create collaborative teams, and he loved it.

I am not sure if he understood that I've done all of that remotely. But he should since he knows that my job right now is remote, and that I work with people all over the world.

I haven't spoken with him directly about the remote vs. in-person thing, only through the recruiter. But it turns out they are having a hard time motivating people to come into the office, which is one thing they want this role to help do.

Honestly, I told the recruiter that there is no way for me to be that person. If they hired me, they would definitely see their company working more cohesively and collaboratively across teams, but the primary tools and methods I use are all digital. It would also be more difficult for me to jump from meeting to meeting with various people (many of whom are, again, an entire country away).

There is no way I can be the person who ""gives people a reason to come into the office"" when I have built most of my career remotely and rarely see a reason to work in-person.

Also, I would be managing and building a team. So, just an FYI for everyone, your CEOs may be deliberately not hiring leaders and managers who can lead remote-first teams. Even if they are a great fit.

I'm just now emerging into leadership-level roles that report directly to a CEO, and I guess it's just been super eye-opening to see how forced the RTO is first-hand. I wouldn't even be in the same office as him. They are literally trying to hire people who will \*find\* reasons to push their teams back into the office.

Yikes.

"2024-02-11",1707633526,"Why everyone should cheer for remote work, even if you punch in on-site","Heres the deal:

- Traffics a Nightmare, Right? More folks working from home means fewer cars jamming up the roads. Less traffic equals fewer accidents and a smoother ride for everyone.
- Hunting for Parking Sucks: With less people driving to work, finding a parking spot wont feel like the Hunger Games.
- Delays Be Gone: buses on time more often thanks to less traffic 
- Breath of Fresh Air: With fewer cars on the road, were not just cutting down on noise pollution but also slashing the amount of noxious gases choking up our air. This means a significant bump in air quality, making those deep, city breaths a lot less toxic.
- Healthier, Happier Cities: Embracing remote work could mean not just cleaner air but also fewer sick days for all. With less crowding on public transport and in offices, we're giving contagious diseases fewer chances to spread.
- Local Love, Global Work: By rooting for remote work, we're supporting an economy where spending isn't confined to city centers. It's a shift that promises to rejuvenate neighborhood businesses, as remote workers distribute their dollars closer to home, breathing new life into local markets.

Bottom Line:

If you cant work from home, you should still be all for remote work. Less hassle getting to work, and quicker rides. Plus, driving without playing dodge-the-idiot? Priceless. Remote works making everyones day a bit easier, even if your office is still your second home.","WFH",43,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/1ao1ncm/why_everyone_should_cheer_for_remote_work_even_if/"

1. I login in after hours when I see any requests or if I'm too bored at home or too passionate about a project 

2. Me being happier with my job due to all the benefits means that I give back more to my employee 

3. They are really happy with my performance and wouldn't have been able to hire me if this was an in-person job.

But being a mom, I can not afford 2 hours of commute + an hour in the morning dressing up and packing up to spend 8 miserable in a sad cubicle. I also need my lunch hour to actually prep lunch and do house chores instead of wasting it chatting with colleagues across my cubicle.

So I work at a SaaS company as a Sales Development Rep. Our CEO stated several times last year we would only RTO 1-2 times a week max. 

Fast forward to today, they just informed me that they are uping the RTO to 4 days a week (Its 3 right now).

In order to be seen as in office you have to connect to the wifi in our office first login of the day. What Ive been doing is signing in, working in office for maybe 2 hours, and then leaving and working the rest at home. I live maybe 5 minutes from our office so its not a big deal to me.

I am way more productive at home. I have 2 monitors here vs 1 there and quiet around me to make calls, plus better internet. The best part is our office is one of like 8 and they stopped hiring for our office because its so empty already. Its like a ghost town. I know absolutely zero people in my office because ive been remote for a long time.

I assume others do this too because i see them log in for our afternoon zoom meeting and their backdrop is their home offices. I dont know if theyll ever pick up on this, but if they do and get upset id seriously look for another job because remote work is much better for me personally.

But now, with this hybrid model, my local office feels like a ghost town. Only two survivors remain, each working different shifts, resulting in just one person in the office at any given time. It's like a post-apocalyptic workplace, where we are the sole survivors of the great plague.

"2024-02-01",1706827721,"Employees are spending the equivalent of a months grocery bill on the return to the officeand growing more resentful than ever, new survey finds","https://archive.ph/KhMqO

Despite the benefits of remote work for employees, many organizations are abandoning it in favor of returning to the office full-timeor part-time in a hybrid model. A recent survey from BetterUp shows that the number of primarily remote roles has been cut in halfand one out of four organizations cite improved connection and culture as the business rationale behind mandated office returns.

However, our research found that returning to an office often is a major disruption to ones routine, foundational work, and overall life experience. We surveyed 1,400 full-time U.S. employees who were mandated to return to in-office work and found that they had higher burnout, stress, and turnover intentions. They also had lower trust in their organization, engagement, and productivity levels. Our results indicate that if the return-to-office transition is not handled with a high level of humanity, sensitivity, and empathy, workplace culture suffers, and the workforces sense of belonging plummets.

We also found that RTO results in pressure on employees flexibility, time, and even bank accounts. If you are struggling to adjust to a mandated return to the office, know that you are not alone. 

The main challenges of RTO

There are benefits that come from working in person. For example, research BetterUp has done in partnership with the University of California, Riverside found increased life satisfaction and social connectedness as benefits of in-person interaction over technology-mediated interaction. 

While it seems intuitive that people form better working relationships in person, poorly communicated and implemented return-to-office mandates breed resentment toward employers. Resentful employees are less likely to bring their authentic selves to the workplace and less likely to invest in those around them.
The most challenging aspect of returning to the office is the commute. This isnt surprising because commutes of only 30 minutes are linked to higher stress and anger, while 45 minutes or more is linked to poorer overall well-being, daily mood, and health. 

What is surprising is the second most challenging aspect of returning to work: the loss of flexibility to switch between work and home tasks for things like accepting a delivery or switching over the laundry between meetings. In a time-starved world, even the smallest time savings can be very important as people attempt to do it all. 

While some leaders might read this and think Ah-ha! I knew people were multi-tasking when they should be working!, the truth is, that remote work is actually a net gain for the organization. Research has found that people in remote work give more total hours to the company.  

With disruption comes opportunity

Evidence from BetterUp suggests agency in choice of work arrangement enables people to find a way of work that can optimize performance and well-being.

We also saw that an organizations decision to require in-office work represents a financial burden for employees. The average employee returning to the office spends $561 per month on transportation, additional child and pet care, and domestic assistance. That is comparable to the average two-person households grocery bill in the U.S. for the entire month.
So what can you do if your employer mandates your return-to-office? 

First, focus on maximizing the benefits of this life change, including the opportunity to deepen your relationships and collaborate more with your coworkers. Take advantage of the hybrid work model to connect with the people who are physically there as much as possible (rather than only logging on to virtual meetings).

Second, consider if returning to the office represents an opportunity for better work-life balance. If you are back in the office full-time, can you embrace leaving work at work? Can you create desirable new habits or routines like going to the gym on your way in each day? Shifting back into in-person work is a major systemic disruption, but with that disruption comes the opportunity to design healthier habits.

Finally, ask for what you need to thrive while returning to the office. Do you need a late start so you can continue to drop your kids off at school? Do you need better commuter benefits to offset financial costs? Do you need a coach to support you as you make the transition back to the office? Thoughtfully raise these needs with your manager.

Return-to-office mandates can affect employees and not necessarily in the ways that leaders are hoping. If you are in a situation where you are being asked to dramatically shift your way of working, know that its normal to find this transition difficult, to have a mix of emotions about it, and most importantly, that its never wrong to ask for what you need.

Now they are telling employees that everyone that works for corporate needs to report to an office 3 days a week even if they were hired as a remote employee. Relocate or Resign is the motto. This is clearly stealth layoffs and many other companies are going to try the same tactic as the economy slows and companies don't want to pay unemployment.

*The fallout from such a policy can be devastating to team morale and corporate culture  two cornerstones of any organizations success. Forcing employees to relocate can severely destabilize team morale, similar to a gust of wind sweeping through a delicately constructed house of cards.

At an office, you have to worry about socializing, how you present yourself, and all those little annoying things. Last time I had to go to an office, I had trouble sleeping some nights because I just didnt feel calm.

I work for a university and my role is generally remote throughout different departments. I was hired as a remote employee as I live three hours away from the office. 

My manager has been micromanaging me to the extreme, she has to be CCd on all emails and wants me to send an update every single day for tasks. She keeps calling me to the office in the middle of the week randomly for training purposes. It takes me 6 hours to do  commute for a 2 hour training session that can be done remotely. The training session consists of her making me sit on her computer and do menial tasks with her watching over me. 

Im constantly under stress of commuting 6 hours to the office every week as she calls me whenever she desires and according to her schedule since she lives 15 mins away. I dont make a lot of money and a majority of it goes towards rent and commute. 

Ive brought it up multiple times that the commute is causing me financial hardship and an entire day is wasted and I have to work additional hours in the week to catch up. She doesnt seem to understand my hardships and is very critical of everything I do. 

Im dealing with so much stress. My last paycheck was not received and my manager decided to call me on Friday today and I finally refused. Ive complied to all her in office requests but due to not receiving my paycheck , I just cannot afford to commute and plus I already have plans on babysitting my niece. 

Im stressing out so much that she will say something when she doesnt see me in the office as even though I said I will not be able to come, she still insisted and I got way too annoyed and didnt even reply. There have been instances where she has called me in but hasnt come in herself as she messed up the calendar and Im just making my three hour commute back. 

I feel she is not a good manager and Im not being heard. Im at the verge of quitting as this is causing me too much stress and I dont like the work.

TL;DR  RTO is awesome because bosses can be rude in person and they don't have to let anyone finish what they're saying like in a Zoom meeting.

Also office busybodies and gossips get to keep tabs on their co-workers love lives.  Sharing that is ""very human"" even though it's definitely NUNYA.

So we have to RTO to share and be humans, not to prop up commercial real estate like the giant SalesForce building that is an exercise in ego in mid-town Manhattan?  Yeah, right.

There was times I was fully remote during covid so i got a feel of what it was like and the sleep was great. I used to rush to be in at 8-8:30 in the office (we had daily meetings at 8 which was hell. If I was running late Id take it over the phone but having it so early shouldve been illegal). Starting early is one thing but needing to do the status update and small talk shit so early sucked on top of everything else. 

Now, I can log on between 8 and 8:30, make a coffee sometime before 9 and also a quick breakfast. Before Id be scrambling to pick up a greasy breakfast sandwich or rush to buy a coffee , unless my sweet bf had made breakfast / coffee for me because I just suck at waking up early enough to do all that, plus get ready to be in at 8 am. 

Its only a few weeks of me being remote and already, my cortisol levels have adapted to not needing to be in a massive rush as soon as I get up. I wash my face or shower, get changed, log on, check my emails and a few other things, and then get my breakfast and coffee made and sit at my desk again in peace and quiet. No more how was your weekend chats the minute I clock into work. We still have touch point meetings but they are later on and by then Im usually more awake; being fully remote I like having these too as it gives me a chance to ask questions and touch base with people I may not otherwise talk to in the day. Its so much more useful having a daily touch point when youre remote as most of the time it felt painful and pointless in the office . 

Its been an absolute game changer for me to not feel a huge sense of dread the second I wake up, first because in the office I get way more social interaction than I want and need from coworkers, second, because I suck at waking up early and know I will be practically bolting out the door, hungry and tired much of the time. Its been so nice working at home.

Management here doubled down and insisted that there would be no remote work at all. The lead told everyone that work from home would only be allowed for excused absences (sick kid, waiting on cable guy, etc.). They made clear that no one would have regular WFH days. 

In November my manager pulled me aside and told me to stop talking about WFH. Told me point blank that it wouldn't happen, and that team members would be disciplined if they kept discussing it with one another. So I stopped talking about WFH...and started looking for remote jobs. 

Today I got an offer! It's about 15% higher salary with better benefits, and 100% remote. In the interview I asked about the likelihood of return to office.

Parking at the train station was $5 per day. Dry cleaning was averaging about $75 per month. Wear and tear on car, gas, etc. Not to mention; bullshit office politics, lonely coworkers who want to come chat for an hour, constant meetings that required attendance from everyone&oh and my favorite part about my specific office: its in a major city and theres a huge tent city literally right across the street from the office.

Before I took this job, I was freelancing and traveling up to 2-3 hours one way sometimes for gigs. I felt like I was living in my car half of the time and the gigs, while they paid decent, sometimes involved 10-14 hour days with the travel.

This past week, I got a notification from the health app on my phone saying that my resting heart rate dropped 8bpm over the past 6 weeks. I was not expecting to see such a change so soon! This is a very big deal for me, as I have been on high blood pressure medication for over a year now. I would like to eventually move to a lower dose of medication, and maybe even have one less pill to take. I've been walking around my neighborhood more while the weather is still decent too.

The only downside is that I make about the same with my full time position as I did with freelancing, but having the reduced stress, as well as less wear and tear on the car is a major plus.

"2024-04-05",1712278434,"Fate &amp; Coincidence","My husband works for a software company. In 2020, like many others, he went remote full time. In 2022, the company changed from full time to hybrid. Husband started working in the office twice a week (Tuesday and &amp; Wednesday) and Monday, Thursday, and Friday were still WFH.

Last month the company decided to add a third day into the schedule for RTO so now Husband had to be in office Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. This went into effect today. Suffice to say, a lot of employees (including my husband) were not happy about it.

Husband texts me and says they have to evacuate the building. When he arrives home, he tells me that a there was structural damage inside the building, and a load bearing wall was about to collapse. Apparently even the fire marshal was involved and ordered the office to be shut down. A company-wide email is sent out shortly after declaring everyone is fully remote until further notice. 

Husband is now back to working remote five days a week at least for a few weeks, if not longer. :)","WFH",13,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/1bw4kdf/fate_coincidence/"
"2023-08-20",1692539856,"I really wish hybrid jobs would be more upfront about what they mean by hybrid...","Generally, unless I'm told otherwise, if a job is described as 'hybrid' I'm going to assume it's 2 or 3 days per week in office then remainder at home. But I've seen jobs described as hybrid which are less than this (1 day a week, maybe even just 1 day a month) or more, sometimes essentially being a full time office role with rare occasions of WFH as a 'perk'.

And I get that any mix of office and remote is technically hybrid so none of these are inaccurate, but would it be so difficult for job ads to have a brief section laying out what their expectations are?

Whether that's 'we want you in on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday no questions asked' or  'we'd like you in once or twice a week but don't particularly care which days they are' or 'just come into office or work from home as you please, just get the work done' or any of the other thousands of permutations there are. But all of these mean *very* different things from a work-life balance perspective. 

Not being clear from the outset achieves nothing but wasting everyone's time.

E.g. If someone needs to have Wednesdays WFH  let's say for childcare related reasons, and only after the application and interview stages are told 'you have to be in on Wednesdays' with no flexibility... said person who previously thought they could take the job now knows they can't and has wasted time effort and money in applying. The company has likewise wasted time and effort they needn't have if they'd just been clear about their expectations.

After going into the office and being ""available in person"" for HR and the few people that will be going into the office regularly. I'd like to share some details about this wonderful experience I have been going through. /s

First off, my HR department is completely unchecked, and they have the mindset of ""our way or the highway"" so any pushback I give, they go directly to my higherups to complain about me. Which lucky for me, my higherups have my back since IT doesnt report to HR, and IT has a standard process for everything. I hate how under a microscope I feel as of recently

Second, I commute into the office, buy my lunch, and leave my dog home in his crate for 6-9 hrs a day to sit in my IT closet and do the same work I do at home, and maybe talk to 1-2 people a day. Which these interactions can 100% be resolved remotely with proper planning. ""we need this conference room setup for a meeting this afternoon, it hasnt been working for a while"" , Then tell me about it sooner than the morning of the meeting.

I used to go in probably once ever 2 weeks for 1-2 hrs with a checklist of things to complete, then I'd leave again and finish my day from home. 

I work very well with clear goals and little super vision, and my higherups (who all work remotely throughout the US and India) know this and like my performance. But this local HR team is beginning to be too much for me to deal with. I can do things how I want, and it's negatively impacting my work.

The confusing thing about the whole situation is that before I left for my 2 week vacation I was told, unofficially(but from someone who should be correct on these details) that we were looking to downsize office spaces and move to a more remote work style to cut down on office space. Then the day after I get back from my trip, I'm hit with the ""why arent you in the office?"" LOL like cmon guys use your brains here.

(https://www.wsj.com/articles/remote-work-from-home-boss-d093a36c)

&gt; In a survey of 13,000 office workers in six countries published this month, McKinsey found the largest share of employees who strongly prefer to work from home were those who earn more than $150,000.

And 

&gt; The survey also showed 44% of the most senior workers are holding fast to their work-from-home preferencesevidence that continued flexibility remains a lure for attracting and retaining top performers.

Theres been this assumption that RTO is being pushed by bosses and senior folks. But if 44% of senior people would rather go hybrid or WFH (or leave) it means RTO beyond hybrid is going to be pretty unworkable.

"2023-09-06",1694023296,"WFH Thoughts","Two thoughts in my brain recently about WFH. 

1 - Modern life is BUSY. 

Modern life includes all sorts of minutiae like calling the insurance company and fixing door hinges and booking the kids dentist appointments. Most households now have all adults working full-time to make ends meet, so all this minutiae gets shoehorned into evenings and weekends. 

WFH gives us back a tiny shred of balance; we can get the laundry turned over at noon instead of starting it at 7pm. We can log off at 5pm and start dinner at 5:10 instead of starting at 6pm. Time spent commuting becomes time for everything else in life. Letting the dishwasher repair guy in, then handing him a credit card when hes done, becomes a 10 minute thing instead of burning through a whole day of PTO. 

Ive been thinking a lot about how in the traditional family with a stay-at-home partner (usually the wife), Dad worked 40 hours at work while Mom worked 30-40 hours on the kids and house. Now? The parents work 80 hours between the two of them, then you add those 30-40 hours of domestic minutiae. Families are now working 110-120 hours a week. Were hanging on to WFH with all our might partly because those reclaimed hours are a game changer. 

2 - People who say remote teams cant collaborate are cut from a certain personality cloth. 

Theyre generally extroverts - and crucially, theyre people who dont communicate well in writing. Email and instant messaging tools dont work for them. (I have one colleague whose emails always require a bit of head scratching and translating what was actually meant). 

Meanwhile, Im an introvert who communicates best in writing. More than 10 years ago, I was part of an online forum; we collaborated on a massive book project which included submissions from hundreds of people around the planet. It was awesome, and built such a camaraderie that I still talk to some of those people nearly daily. 

On the flip side, my last pre-pandemic job was fully on-site. My only contact with those colleagues now is in the occasional social media like. For people like me (and I think Reddit naturally selects such types), remote work is the best thing that could have happened.

ETA the title should say ""news"" 

I recently started a fully remote job for an employer in another state. They have done remote work on the team since before the pandemic so it feels like a stable situation. 

I'm so grateful to have found this opportunity as fully remote wotk has been a goal of mine. However, all these articles coming out about companies requiring employees to go to the office really piss me off. If there are legitimate business reasons to be there then fine... But likely not legitimate for office jobs to mandatorily be there 3-5 days a week. 

My former employer was flexible but still required 1-2 days a week on site. Whenever I was there it was a ghost town and I still had zoom meetings all day. So annoying to get all dressed up, pack a lunch, drive 30 mins, park, walk to the office, and then just sit there alone. The afternoon commute was pretty brutal as well. If there were people there they talked my ear off and I got very little accomplished.

**Hybrid job:** 175k TC with a large multinational corporation. Company has huge brand recognition and would be good to have on my resume. Requires 2-3 days a week on site, the office is about 35 minutes without traffic and about an hour with traffic one way. Sounds horrible but my last job was fully remote and I honestly missed leaving the house and interacting with people. I was laid off from my last job too so the idea of working for a stable MNC sounds kinda nice. The team at this company also seems very enjoyable to work with and despite the traffic, I expect decent work-life-balance. This job is also in a part of town where I have a lot of friends who I don't get to see as much so this will give me more opportunities to do so after work.

**Remote job:** 200k TC with a fifty person start up. The company itself seems like a shit show based on all my interactions with them during the recruiting process. This job will also require lots of early mornings and late nights because I would be working closely with many offshore teams. Its a slightly more senior position than the hybrid job, but it will likely be way more stressful because its a startup and they seem to lack a lot of business processes.

Theyre in a fairly rural area and as a result have a hard time finding people with experience that they can put into more senior roles like mine. 

I work a lot with our customers and the products I manage represent about $200M in revenue. A large part of that business is due to the relationships Ive developed with our customers. They definitely have other options. 

Anyway, I was 100% WFH all through Covid and through the experience, I came to a few realizations. Mainly that I hated the commute, an hour each way. I live in a small city and commute out to the boonies for work. 

So, when we started going back to the office, I wasnt really happy about it, but in my case, it was only 1 day/week, and thats probably reasonable for my job. Then it was 3 days in office but only if you filled out a form and justified it. A couple of months ago, they announced that we were all going back to full RTO, 5 days/week. I tried to protest, but despite data to the contrary my boss, his boss and on up the chain firmly believe the Were more productive IN the office! BS. 

Theyre having a hard time hiring. Candidates will ask in the phone screen, Is this position remote or hybrid? and as soon as they hear, No, were in the office 5days/week., 90% of the candidates will say, Im not interested then. Needless to say, this means there are a lot of open positions. 

Retention is declining slowly, but its mostly among people with just a couple of YOE and its easier to spread the workload around to the other employees doing the same work. 

Ive tried giving feedback to management that I was not happy with RTO, but they were not listening. So about 2-3 months ago I started looking elsewhere, just casually at first, but almost immediately, I started getting interviews and then an offer at a company that is about 10 minutes away. Much better pay, better benefits, more vacation and best of all theres pretty much a Come in to the office if you need/want to otherwise WFH. Theyre also paying for a nice sit/stand desk and a chair to use at home. Offer accepted!

I type up my notice letter, print 3 copies. Its just the basic three sentences. (Thank you for the opportunities, Its time to move on and this date will be my last day) One copy for my boss, one for his boss and one for HR. The HR copy I drop in their mailbox and the other two, I leave in their respective offices on their keyboards. Then I go about my day.

The next morning, Im greeted by my boss and his boss both of whom are wearing a scowling version of the surprised Pikachu face. They ask me why. I tell them I havent been happy for a while and if they have to ask, they havent been paying attention. 

They make a counteroffer, I decline. They make a better one, I decline again. They ask me what they can do to get me to stay. Finally, I tell them that theres nothing to be done about it at this point, the time to act was all of those times I asked to WFH whenever possible and was denied. Repeatedly. They werent happy about the breakup, but they made their bed, let them lie in it. 

During my transition, I tried to wrap things up as best I could and lay out the immediate needs for each project and I informed my customers. 

I dont know exactly what the fallout from my departure was, but one of my former colleagues did tell me that its been a complete shitshow.

It's like it's so easy to set boundaries, you can keep your margins razor thin end enjoy life right up to the moment you sit down in your home office.

That got us discussing all the different ways working from home can benefit your health. We came up with a lot, but I'm curious which other ways people have found WFH benefits their overall health.

Besides WFH being great for socialization and work/life balance, it's a great way to eat better which leads to feeling a lot better. And it's much easier to make time to exercise or just take a nice walk outside.

Finally, WFH has been a huge improvement to my work-time ergonomics. We have an ergonomics specialist on staff who meets with remote employees to ensure they've got a healthy &amp; comfortable set up. It's really made a big difference to be able to make my working environment perfect for me.

* Employees decide they'd rather not RTO, so they quit
* Employer doesn't have to lay off any, or as many people, due to the quitters.

Sure, some people have avoided the RTO mandates for now.  But if your employer is playing this ploy, those who ignore the mandate will be fired.

I started a new job in August 2021 that was fully remote at that point due to COVID, with the idea that wed move to a hybrid model in time. After 8 months, we moved to two days a week on-site. This was great for about another 8-9 months. 

At that point my partner and I were starting to talk about moving in together. He owns his place, I rented, so it made sense to move into his place. Id been renting an apartment a five minute drive from my office; his place is a 35 min to 45 min drive, but I figured I could deal with it twice a week. 

In February, we were told we needed to start coming in 4x a week because reasons. (There is zero business case that anyone has been able to convey. It appears the real reason is - surprise, surprise - to justify commercial office space). 

Ive just finished moving in with my partner, and wow, did I underestimate how much a 45 minute drive to work SUCKS after having not done any meaningful commuting since Feb 2020. I get so much less sleep now that I have to deal with shower/hair/makeup/commute before getting my day started. In the evening, Im so much more exhausted after work. 

Im an individual contributor, so by design I need to ignore other people in order to do my work. My work doesnt lend itself to collaboration. The only collaborating that happens is my small team sitting around venting to each other about how utterly pointless it is to be on-site.

On top of this, my company is doing renovations to our office space. I was told with just a few hours notice last month that I had to pack up everything and move to a new cubicle to make way for construction work. No one told IT, and my new cubicle wasnt wired for Ethernet (and the wifi constantly drops). Its been a month and still no Ethernet. 

So I have to get up early, get all dolled up, pack a lunch, then spend 45 min in traffic  just to use the same laptop I could use at home, but also having to use my personal phone as a mobile hotspot when the wifi drops.

Working remotely gives me the ability to gate keep my time and it is my absolute favorite benefit of it. 

Ill be honest& I get petty with it and sort of retaliate sometimes lol. When I see this, I will let the message sit longer before I answer back or even jump into a fake meeting, mark myself away, or whatever. I switch it up.

2) Senior level jobs are more likely to be remote than mid-level and entry-level jobs

5.35% of senior-level jobs were remote in the past year, compared to 4.9% for mid-level and 2.48% for entry level. 

Remote work is a privilege that must be earned and companies seem to trust experienced professionals more with that privilege

3) Director and VP jobs were more likely to be remote than individual contributor jobs

This one surprised me a bit as we've heard the stories on how senior executives want employees back in the office. 

But the data tells a different story. Companies are more likely to hire VP and Directors remotely than lower level workers. This was true even in the tech sector, among both big companies and startups.

4) Preferences for remote work differ drastically by profession and industry

Engineers and tech workers vastly prefer working remotely. In fact, the large majority prefer 5 days a week of remote work.

When I polled my Twitter followers (who primarily work in the financial industry), they all preferred a hybrid environment, and a fair share even preferred working 1-2 days at home a week.

5) Salaries for remote jobs are essentially the same as non-remote jobs

I compared the average salary of jobs that were remote to those that were non-remote for the same job title. There was essentially no difference between the two.

6) Remote jobs from US-based companies have stayed mostly within the US.

Whether it's because of legal or logistical reasons, most remote jobs from US-based companies have remained in the US, and that trend has been fairly consistent the past 4-5 years. 

I also analyzed which countries have the highest % of remote jobs, which job titles are most likely to be remote, and whether theres a correlation between remote work and work satisfaction.

My manager who took over the role a year and change ago,  started asking those of us within her city range to come into the office once a month for a department wide meeting six months ago.

All good....or so i thought.  What's once a month?  Well found out from a colleague who lives near me that the manager changed that employees work location to NYC from the suburbs ...and wanted to change mine also to Nyc.

That would trigger an automatic 4% tax in our wages for NYC commuter tax.

My colleague found out from our team lead,  Who slipped it  that the ultimate plan was to then move the 4 of us who lived within 90 miles of NYc  from a team of 30 to come back to the office at first once a month...then once a week...then twice a week to ease us into full time in office.

That would cost 6 grand a year in commuting costs plus 3 grand plus a year in taxes, not to mention 4 hours round trip daily commute.

Why did they want this? Because they wanted to manage the 4 of us directly.  Stupidity as for the last 3 years we were 100% remote with no issues.

My colleague opened an Hr case and brought it to the highest levels of management how 4 of us because of proximity to Nyc were being treated in a disparate, inequitable, and discriminatory  manner (we are all over 40 vs rest of team 30 yr old average age).......and won.

Now all monthly in office meetings are cancelled as due to HR rules, we would have to be re imbursed the $ 50 a day commuting cost and the 3 hours of commute time either paid as overtime or included in our daily hours.

Ive still only been going two days a week at most. I wont do 3.  Id prefer to never be onsite. The work I do doesnt require it 90% of the time.

Any advice on how to push back is much appreciated!","WFH",466,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/17knpnx/fully_wfh_job_wants_to_cut_my_pay_25_when_i_move/"

I joined a company last year. It's fully remote. I actually remained unemployed for some time just to get a remote job as my previous employer went RTO. Work has been amazing. We haven't missed a single deadline. Everyone is working happily. 

We had an AMA with executives a few days back and someone is asking them to have a physical office. What?! This dumbass joins a fully remote company and wants them to have an office and ruin everyone's work-life balance? Great work! 

Even though execs don't have a plan to do so. I wish this guy could get an RTO just for him so that he can spend 2 hrs each day in commute. Screw you dude!

Edit: We also have a WeWork space booked for anyone who wants to work in office. This guy just wanted everyone else to join him.

Edit 2: There are some people in comments talking about how wfh is miserable for them. Yes, for some people wfh doesn't work and they need office but just because it doesn't work for you, it doesn't mean that others need to come to office. This should be common knowledge. 

""Oh but it's not good for your growth."" I think adults can decide what's good for them and what isn't.

""Home is like a prison for me"" Maybe, and just maybe, it isn't for others and some people like to be with their loved ones all the time.","WFH",175,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/16cn1m6/whats_wrong_with_some_people/"

Anyone else feels stuck due to remote benefits?","I have been working from home for 5 months now and while I love all the benefits it brings, I actually hate my role. I work in HR so it's difficult to ever get a remote job in this field and my employer made a very special exception for me. I've looked all over and most of the jobs are hybrid and that will require me to move 2 hours north of where I am currently living.

Anyone ever feels stuck in the job they are in only because it's fully remote and no one else is offering it around them? All the other fully remote jobs I've looked at require a 50% or more paycut and also has thousands of applicants (I would also be taking a step back in my career).","WFH",78,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/1bdnapi/hate_job_but_love_wfh_anyone_else_feels_stuck_due/"
"2023-10-01",1696124945,"Been WFHing for 5 years and Im becoming more successful each year","It started in 2018 when I joined Doordash as a Software Engineer (100% self taught). Initially I would commute to SF (1.5 hrs each way) but when I started WFHing 3 days a week nobody seemed to care. Eventually I told boss Id work from their Mountain View office but would rarely show up. Nobody cared.

Then the pandemic hit and I joined Meta as a senior engineer. Worked 100% remotely for 2 years until I quit and joined a web 3 company. Kept working remotely and became an Engineer Manager!

I recently started a startup (HiringCafe - a job board to find remote jobs - LOL) and have been working 100% remotely with my cofounder from day 1. We even got funding from a well known investor in SF.

I hear people complain about how its hard to brainstorm ideas and be productive remotely but for me personally I would credit WFH for much of my recent success.

I cant explain how satisfying it is for me to walk outside of my home to a park and come up with ideas and share them with my cofounder on the phone, then head back to my home office and code up a solution. We collaborate well together and have 0 problems so far. Were always available to each other though so that definitely helps.

I think it boils down to self discipline and truly enjoying your time while working from home. If it werent for the walks in the park or the quality family time at a random time in a day, I dont think Id enjoy it as much.

But then again, it might not be for everyone. It certainly is for me though!","WFH",52,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/16wogdb/been_wfhing_for_5_years_and_im_becoming_more/"
